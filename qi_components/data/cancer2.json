Lung cancer and primary malignant brain cancer, most commonly glioblastoma, are genetically heterogeneous diseases with extremely poor prognoses. In this review, we summarize the data demonstrating that glycosylation is altered in lung and brain cancer. We then use specific examples to highlight the diverse roles of glycosylation in these two deadly diseases and illustrate shared mechanisms of oncogenesis. In addition to alterations in glycoconjugate biosynthesis, we also discuss mechanisms of postsynthetic glycan modification in cancer. We suggest that alterations in glycosylation in lung and brain cancer provide novel tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

To make full use of glycans for clinical applications, we need more detailed information on the location, nature, and dynamics of glycan expression in vivo. Such studies require the use of specimens acquired directly from patients. Effective studies of clinical specimens require low-volume assays, high precision measurements, and the ability to process many samples. Assays using affinity reagents\u2014lectins and glycan-binding antibodies\u2014can meet these requirements, but further developments are needed to make the methods routine and effective. Recent advances in the use of glycan-binding proteins involve improved determination of specificity using glycan arrays; the availability of databases for mining and analyzing glycan array data; lectin engineering methods; and the ability to quantitatively interpret lectin measurements. Here, we describe many of the challenges and opportunities involved in the application of these new approaches to the study of biological samples. The new tools hold promise for developing methods to improve the outcomes of patients afflicted with diseases characterized by aberrant glycan expression. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Ball<br>\n<br>\n The inducible, nutrient-sensitive posttranslational modification of protein Ser/Thr residues with O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) occurs on histones, transcriptional regulators, metabolic enzymes, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and many critical intermediates of growth factor signaling. Cycling of O-GlcNAc modification on and off of protein substrates is catalyzed by the actions of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively. To date, there are less than 150 publications addressing the role of O-GlcNAc modification in cancer and over half were published in the last 2years. These studies have clearly established that increased expression of OGT and hyper-O-GlcNAcylation is common to human cancers of breast, prostate, colon, lung, and pancreas. Furthermore, attenuating OGT activity reduces tumor growth in vitro and metastasis in vivo. This chapter discusses the structure and function of the O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes, mechanisms by which protein O-GlcNAc modification sense changes in nutrient status, the influence of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes on glucose metabolism, and provides an overview of recent observations regarding the role of O-GlcNAcylation in cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Radionuclide imaging is the most popular form of imaging to be used for molecular imaging in oncology. While many types of molecules have been used for radionuclide-based molecular imaging, there has been a great interest in developing newer nanomaterials for use in clinic, especially for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanomaterials have unique physical properties which allow them to be used as imaging probes to locate and identify cancerous lesions. Over the past decade, a great number of nanoparticles have been developed for radionuclide imaging of cancer. This chapter reviews the different kinds of nanomaterials, both organic and inorganic, which are currently being researched for as potential agents for nuclear imaging of variety of cancers. Several radiolabeled multifunctional nanocarriers have been extremely successful for the detection of cancer in preclinical models. So far, significant progress has been achieved in nanoparticle structure design, in vitro/in vivo trafficking, and in vivo fate mapping by using PET. There is a great need for the development of newer nanoparticles, which improve active targeting and quantify new biomarkers for early disease detection and possible prevention of cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Research over the past few decades has produced significant findings that illustrate the importance of cancer-specific alterations in glycosylation in the regulation of tumor formation and metastasis. The identification of glycan-based biomarkers and strategies targeting specific glycan epitopes on the tumor cell surface has become one of the widely pursued research areas. In this chapter, we will summarize and provide perspective on available knowledge about the functional roles that glycan structures play in the development and progression of the gynecological cancers, breast and ovarian, with a specific focus on N-linked glycans.

Aboagye<br>\n<br>\n Over recent years, there has been a rapid expansion in our knowledge of the factors that regulate tumor growth; this has resulted in the identification of new therapeutic targets and improvements in the long-term survival of cancer patients. New noninvasive biomarkers of drug targets and pathway modulation in vivo are needed to guide therapy selection and detect drug resistance early so that alternative, more effective treatments can be offered. The translation of new therapeutics into the clinic is disappointingly slow, expensive, and subject to high rates of attrition often occurring at late stages (phase 3) of development. In an attempt to mitigate these delays and failures, there has been resurgence in the development of new molecular imaging probes for studies with positron emission tomography (PET) to characterize tumor biology. In the assessment of therapeutic effects, PET allows imaging of entire tumor burden in a noninvasive repeatable manner. This chapter focuses on the clinical translation of PET imaging agents from bench to bedside. New probes are being used to study a diverse range of processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, fatty acid metabolism, and growth factor receptor expression. In the future, validation of these novel imaging probes could allow more innovative therapies to be adapted earlier in the clinic leading to improved patient outcomes. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Gambhir<br>\n<br>\n The field of tumor immunology has seen an explosion of renewed interest over the last decade. With the FDA approval of new immunotherapies for prostate cancer and melanoma, as well as several exciting new drugs in clinical trials, tumor immunology is becoming an increasingly important topic in preclinical studies and patient care. However, the current methods for assessing the immune status of a patient and tumor are limited, which has led to the development of novel molecular imaging methods for assessing tumor immunology. From cell tracking for cellular therapeutics to assessing the tumor immune microenvironment, these imaging methods have the potential to further preclinical understanding of immunotherapies and potentially translate into clinically useful tests to predict and assess therapeutic response of these exciting new agents. In this review, we first discuss the recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, followed by a detailed review of the current state of molecular imaging for tumor immunology. Finally, we discuss opportunities for further development and innovation in this rapidly growing field. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Chan<br>\n<br>\n Molecular imaging plays an important role in the era of personalized medicine, especially with recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) probes.

This represents a paradigm switch from the previously commercialized gadolinium and iron oxide probes to probes with new capabilities, and leads to new challenges as scanner hardware needs to be adapted for detecting these probes. In this chapter, we highlight the unique features for all five different categories of MR probes, including the emerging chemical exchange saturation transfer, 19F, and hyperpolarized probes, and describe the key physical properties and features motivating their design. As part of this comparison, the strengths and weaknesses of each category are discussed. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The synthesis of HA starts from the cytosolic precursors UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid. These two sugar nucleotides have several functions in addition to glycoconjugate synthesis and glucuronidation reactions, each of which can have a critical role in cancer. HA is synthesized by a family of three HA synthase (HAS) enzymes and, in this review, we described the main posttranslational modifications that are known to regulate HA metabolism. In particular, as the main HAS in adult tissues is HAS2, we focused on the role of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and glycosylation by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) of HAS2 which mediate HAS2 inactivation and activation, respectively. HA catabolism, furnishing glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, can represent for a cancer cell a valid source of substrates to sustain complex tumor metabolism, and we highlight a presumable metabolic fate of such sugars in tumor cells. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Pilarski<br>\n<br>\n It is becoming increasingly apparent that splicing defects play a key role in cancer, and that alterations in genomic splicing elements promote aberrant splicing. Alternative splicing increases the diversity of the human transcriptome and increases the numbers of functional gene products. However, dysregulation that leads to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing can contribute to cancer. Hyaluronan (HA), known to be an important component of cancer progression, is synthesized by hyaluronan synthases (HASs). In cancer cells, hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) pre-mRNA is abnormally spliced to generate a family of aberrant splice variants (HAS1Vs) that synthesize extracellular and intracellular HA. HAS1Vs are clinically relevant, being found almost exclusively in malignant cells. Expression of aberrant HAS1Vs predicts poor survival in multiple myeloma. In this review, we summarize the unusual properties of HAS1Vs and their relationship to cancer. HAS1Vs form heterogeneous multimers with normally spliced HAS1 as well as with each other and with HAS3. Aberrant variants of HAS1 synthesize HA. Extracellular HA synthesized by HAS1Vs is likely to promote malignant spread. We speculate that synthesis of intracellular HA plays a fundamental and early role in oncogenesis by promoting genetic instability and the emergence of viable cancer variants that lead to aggressive disease. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Lokeshwar , Summan  Mirza , Andre  Jordan<br>\n<br>\n Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) is perhaps one of the most uncomplicated large polymers that regulates several normal physiological processes and, at the same time, contributes to the manifestation of a variety of chronic and acute diseases, including cancer. Members of the HA signaling pathway (HA synthases, HA receptors, and HYAL-1 hyaluronidase) have been experimentally shown to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis, and hence each of them is a potential target for cancer therapy. Furthermore, as these members are also overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas, targeting of the HA family is clinically relevant. A variety of targeted approaches have been developed to target various HA family members, including small-molecule inhibitors and antibody and vaccine therapies. These treatment approaches inhibit HA-mediated intracellular signaling that promotes tumor cell proliferation, motility, and invasion, as well as induction of endothelial cell functions. Being nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and versatile for modifications, HA has been used in nanoparticle preparations for the targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs and other anticancer compounds to tumor cells through interaction with cell-surface HA receptors. This review discusses basic and clinical translational aspects of targeting each HA family member and respective treatment approaches that have been described in the literature. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Simpson<br>\n<br>\n Hyaluronidases are a family of five human enzymes that have been differentially implicated in the progression of many solid tumor types, both clinically and in functional studies. Advances in the past 5 years have clarified many apparent contradictions: (1) by demonstrating that specific hyaluronidases have alternative substrates to hyaluronan (HA) or do not exhibit any enzymatic activity, (2) that high-molecular weight HA polymers elicit signaling effects that are opposite those of the hyaluronidase-digested HA oligomers, and (3) that it is actually the combined overexpression of HA synthesizing enzymes with hyaluronidases that confers tumorigenic potential. This review examines the literature supporting these conclusions and discusses novel mechanisms by which hyaluronidases impact invasive tumor cell processes. In addition, a detailed structural and functional comparison of the hyaluronidases is presented with insights into substrate selectivity and potential for therapeutic targeting. Finally, technological advances in targeting hyaluronidase for tumor imaging and cancer therapy are summarized. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Thorek<br>\n<br>\n Cerenkov luminescence (CL) has been used recently in a plethora of medical applications like imaging and therapy with clinically relevant medical isotopes. The range of medical isotopes used is fairly large and expanding. The generation of in vivo light is useful since it circumvents depth limitations for excitation light. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is much cheaper in terms of infrastructure than positron emission tomography (PET) and is particularly useful for imaging of superficial structures. Imaging can basically be done using a sensitive camera optimized for low-light conditions, and it has a better resolution than any other nuclear imaging modality. CLI has been shown to effectively diagnose disease with regularly used PET isotope (18F-FDG) in clinical setting. Cerenkov luminescence tomography, Cerenkov luminescence endoscopy, and intraoperative Cerenkov imaging have also been explored with positive conclusions expanding the current range of applications. Cerenkov has also been used to improve PET imaging resolution since the source of both is the radioisotope being used. Smart imaging agents have been designed based on modulation of the Cerenkov signal using small molecules and nanoparticles giving better insight of the tumor biology. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Bhujwalla<br>\n<br>\n Morbidity and mortality from cancer and their associated conditions and treatments continue to extract a heavy social and economic global burden despite the transformative advances in science and technology in the twenty-first century. In fact, cancer incidence and mortality are expected to reach pandemic proportions by 2025, and costs of managing cancer will escalate to trillions of dollars. The inability to establish effective cancer treatments arises from the complexity of conditions that exist within tumors, the plasticity and adaptability of cancer cells coupled with their ability to escape immune surveillance, and the co-opted stromal cells and microenvironment that assist cancer cells in survival. Stromal cells, although destroyed together with cancer cells, have an ever-replenishing source that can assist in resurrecting tumors from any residual cancer cells that may survive treatment. The tumor microenvironment landscape is a continually changing landscape, with spatial and temporal heterogeneities that impact and influence cancer treatment outcome. Importantly, the changing landscape of the tumor microenvironment can be exploited for precision medicine and theranostics. Molecular and functional imaging can play important roles in shaping and selecting treatments to match this landscape. Our purpose in this review is to examine the roles of molecular and functional imaging, within the context of the tumor microenvironment, and the feasibility of their applications for precision medicine and theranostics in humans. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In recent years, significant effort has been expended in overcoming technical hurdles to enable clinical adoption of molecular-genetic imaging. This chapter will provide an introduction to the components of molecular-genetic imaging and recent advances on each component leading to safe, efficient clinical applications for detecting cancer.

Many of these patients rely on surgical intervention for curative outcomes. This requires a careful identification of the primary and microscopic tumors, and the complete removal of cancer. Although there have been efforts to adapt traditional-imaging modalities for intraoperative image guidance, they suffer from several constraints such as large hardware footprint, high-operation cost, and disruption of the surgical workflow. Because of the ease of image acquisition, relatively low-cost devices and intuitive operation, optical imaging methods have received tremendous interests for use in real-time image-guided surgery. To improve imaging depth under low interference by tissue autofluorescence, many of these applications utilize light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, which is invisible to human eyes. With the availability of a wide selection of tumor-avid contrast agents, advancements in imaging sensors, electronic and optical designs, surgeons are able to combine different attributes of NIR optical imaging techniques to improve treatment outcomes. The emergence of diverse commercial and experimental image guidance systems, which are in various stages of clinical translation, attests to the potential high impact of intraoperative optical imaging methods to improve speed of oncologic surgery with high accuracy and minimal margin positivity. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The major etiology of liver cancer is infection with an hepatotropic virus such as hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. While chronic viral infection remains the main cause of liver disease and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), rates of nonviral-associated HCC are occurring at an alarmingly increasing rate. Like many cancers, survival rates are closely associated with time of detection. If HCC is caught early, survival rates can be as high as 50%. Regrettably, most cases of HCC are caught late where survival rates can be as low as 2\u20137%. Thus, there has been great interest in discovering serum biomarkers that could be used to identify those with HCC. To this end, many groups have examined the N-linked glycans to identify changes that occur with HCC. As the liver secretes the vast majority of proteins into the serum, this has often been a starting point for study. In serum, alterations in core fucosylation, outer-arm fucosylation, increased sialylation, and glycan branching have been observed in patients with HCC. Similar findings have been found directly in HCC tissue suggesting that these glycan changes may play a role in tumor formation and development. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The study of these may contribute to the discovery of biomarkers and treatment targets as well as understanding of cancer biology. We here describe the change of glycosylation specifically defining colorectal cancer with view on N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipid glycans in colorectal cancer cells and tissues as well as patient sera. Glycan alterations observed in colon cancer include increased \u03b21,6-branching and correlating higher abundance of (poly-)N-acetyllactosamine extensions of N-glycans as well as an increase in (truncated) high-mannose type glycans, while bisected structures decrease. Colorectal cancer-associated O-glycan changes are predominated by reduced expression of core 3 and 4 glycans, whereas higher levels of core 1 glycans, (sialyl) T-antigen, (sialyl) Tn-antigen, and a generally higher density of O-glycans are observed. Specific changes for glycosphingolipid glycans are lower abundances of disialylated structures as well as globo-type glycosphingolipid glycans with exception of Gb3. In general, alterations affecting all discussed glycan types are increased sialylation, fucosylation as well as (sialyl) Lewis-type antigens and type-2 chain glycans. As a consequence, interactions with glycan-binding proteins can be affected and the biological function and cellular consequences of the altered glycosylation with regard to tumorigenesis, metastasis, modulation of immunity, and resistance to antitumor therapy will be discussed. Finally, analytical approaches aiding in the field of glycomics will be reviewed with focus on binding assays and mass spectrometry. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The chemokine CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1, binds the G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR4, which, through multiple divergent pathways, leads to chemotaxis, enhanced intracellular calcium, cell adhesion, survival, proliferation, and gene transcription. CXCR4, initially discovered for its involvement in HIV entry and leukocytes trafficking, is overexpressed in more than 23 human cancers. Cancer cell CXCR4 overexpression contributes to tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance. CXCR4 antagonism has been shown to disrupt tumor\u2013stromal interactions, sensitize cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs, and reduce tumor growth and metastatic burden. As such, CXCR4 is a target not only for therapeutic intervention but also for noninvasive monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic guidance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological involvement of CXCR4 in human cancers, the current status of CXCR4-based therapeutic approaches, as well as recent advances in noninvasive imaging of CXCR4 expression. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

These enzymes glycosylate various complex carbohydrates such as glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. The enzyme activity of glycosyltransferases and their gene expression are altered in various pathophysiological situations including cancer. Furthermore, the activity of glycosyltransferases is controlled by various factors such as the levels of nucleotide sugars, acceptor substrates, nucleotide sugar transporters, chaperons, and endogenous lectin in cancer cells. The glycosylation results in various functional changes of glycoproteins including cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and integrins. These changes confer the unique characteristic phenotypes associated with cancer cells. Therefore, glycans play key roles in cancer progression and treatment. This review focuses on glycan structures, their biosynthetic glycosyltransferases, and their genes in relation to their biological significance and involvement in cancer, especially cancer biomarkers, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, cancer progression and metastasis, and therapeutics. Major N-glycan branching structures which are directly related to cancer are \u03b21,6-GlcNAc branching, bisecting GlcNAc, and core fucose. These structures are enzymatic products of glycosyltransferases, GnT-V, GnT-III, and Fut8, respectively. The genes encoding these enzymes are designated as MGAT5 (Mgat5), MGAT3 (Mgat3), and FUT8 (Fut8) in humans (mice in parenthesis), respectively. GnT-V is highly associated with cancer metastasis, whereas GnT-III is associated with cancer suppression. Fut8 is involved in expression of cancer biomarker as well as in the treatment of cancer. In addition to these enzymes, GnT-IV and GnT-IX (GnT-Vb) will be also discussed in relation to cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Schinkel<br>\n<br>\n ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are transmembrane efflux transporters that mediate cellular extrusion of a broad range of substrates ranging from amino acids, lipids, and ions to xenobiotics including many anticancer drugs. ABCB1 (P-GP) and ABCG2 (BCRP) are the most extensively studied apical ABC drug efflux transporters. They are highly expressed in apical membranes of many pharmacokinetically relevant tissues such as epithelial cells of the small intestine and endothelial cells of the blood capillaries in brain and testis, and in the placental maternal\u2013fetal barrier. In these tissues, they have a protective function as they efflux their substrates back to the intestinal lumen or blood and thus restrict the intestinal uptake and tissue disposition of many compounds. This presents a major challenge for the use of many (anticancer) drugs, as most currently used anticancer drugs are substrates of these transporters. Herein, we review the latest findings on the role of apical ABC transporters in the disposition of anticancer drugs. We discuss that many new, rationally designed anticancer drugs are substrates of these transporters and that their oral availability and/or brain disposition are affected by this interaction. We also summarize studies that investigate the improvement of oral availability and brain disposition of many cytotoxic (e.g., taxanes) and rationally designed (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) anticancer drugs, using chemical inhibitors of these transporters. These findings provide a better understanding of the importance of apical ABC transporters in chemotherapy and may therefore advance translation of promising preclinical insights and approaches to clinical studies. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Survival rates of high-risk neuroblastoma remain less than 50%, with amplification of the MYCN oncogene the most important aberration associated with poor outcome. Direct transcriptional targets of MYCN include a number of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, of which ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC3 (MRP3), and ABCC4 (MRP4) are the best characterized. These three transporter genes have been shown to be strongly prognostic of neuroblastoma outcome in primary untreated neuroblastoma. In addition to their ability to efflux a number of chemotherapeutic drugs, evidence suggests that these transporters also contribute to neuroblastoma outcome independent of any role in cytotoxic drug efflux. Endogenous substrates of ABCC1 and ABCC4 that may be potential candidates affecting neuroblastoma biology include molecules such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These bioactive lipid mediators have the ability to influence biological processes contributing to cancer initiation and progression, such as angiogenesis, cell signaling, inflammation, proliferation, and migration and invasion. ABCC1 and ABCC4 are thus potential targets for therapeutic suppression in high-risk neuroblastoma, and recently developed small-molecule inhibitors may be an effective strategy in treating aggressive forms of this cancer, as well as other cancers that express high levels of these transporters. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Schuetz<br>\n<br>\n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by aberrant proliferation and/or differentiation of myeloid progenitors. However, only ~65% of AML patients respond to induction chemotherapy and the overall survival rate for AML remains low (~24% for 5-year survival). The conventional view suggests that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to treatment failure due to their drug-effluxing capabilities. This might be overly simplistic. Some ABC transporters export endogenous substrates that have defined roles in normal hematopoietic progenitors. It is conceivable that these substances also provide an advantage to leukemic progenitors. This review will highlight how certain endogenous substrates impact normal hematopoietic cells and suggest that ABC transporters facilitate export of these substances to affect both normal hematopoietic and leukemic progenitors. For example, the ability to export certain endogenous ligands may facilitate leukemogenesis by modifying leukemic progenitor cell proliferation or survival. If so, the addition of ABC transporter inhibitors to traditional chemotherapy might improve therapeutic efficacy by not just increasing intracellular drug accumulation but also blocking the beneficial effects ABC transporter ligands have on cell survival. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Both ABCB1 and ABCG2 are capable of transporting a wide range of hydrophobic drugs and xenobiotics and are involved in cancer chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, the exploration of their mechanism of action has major therapeutic consequences. As discussed here in detail, both ABCB1 and ABCG2 are significantly affected by various lipid compounds especially those residing in their close proximity in the plasma membrane. ABCB1 is capable of transporting lipids and lipid derivatives, and thus may alter the general membrane composition by \u201cflopping\u201d membrane lipid constituents, while there is no such information regarding ABCG2. Still, both ABCB1 and ABCG2 show complex interactions with a variety of lipid molecules, and the transporters are significantly modulated by cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives at the posttranslational level. In this chapter, we explore the molecular details of the direct transporter\u2013lipid interactions, the potential role of lipid-sensor domains within the proteins, as well as the application of experimental site-directed mutagenesis, detailed structural studies, and in silico modeling for examining these interactions. We also discuss the regulation of ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression at the transcriptional level, occurring through nuclear receptors involved in lipid sensing.

These transporters function as ATP-driven efflux pumps for xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. High expression of these ABC transporters at the barrier is a major obstacle to the delivery of therapeutics, including chemotherapeutics, to the CNS. Here, I review the signals that alter ABC transporter expression and transport function with an emphasis on P-glycoprotein, Mrp2, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), the efflux transporters for which we have the most detailed picture of regulation. Recent work shows that transporter protein expression can be upregulated in response to inflammatory and oxidative stress, therapeutic drugs, diet, and persistent environmental pollutants; as a consequence, drug delivery to the brain is reduced (potentially bad and ugly). In contrast, basal transport activity of P-glycoprotein and BCRP can be reduced through complex signaling pathways that involve events in and on the brain capillary endothelial cells. Targeting these signaling events provides opportunities to rapidly and reversibly increase brain accumulation of drugs that are substrates for the transporters (potentially good). The clinical usefulness of targeting signaling to reduce efflux transporter activity and improve drug delivery to the CNS remains to be established. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Ambudkar<br>\n<br>\n ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein/P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter well known for its association with multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Powered by the hydrolysis of ATP, it effluxes structurally diverse compounds. In this chapter, we discuss current views on the molecular basis of the substrate polyspecificity of P-gp. One of the features that accounts for this property is the structural flexibility observed in P-gp. Several X-ray crystal structures of mouse P-gp have been published recently in the absence of nucleotide, with and without bound inhibitors. All the structures are in an inward-facing conformation exhibiting different degrees of domain separation, thus revealing a highly flexible protein. Biochemical and biophysical studies also demonstrate this flexibility in mouse as well as human P-gp. Site-directed mutagenesis has revealed the existence of multiple transport-active binding sites in P-gp for a single substrate. Thus, drugs can bind at either primary or secondary sites. Biochemical, molecular modeling, and structure\u2013activity relationship studies suggest a large, common drug-binding pocket with overlapping sites for different substrates. We propose that in addition to the structural flexibility, the molecular or chemical flexibility also contributes to the binding of substrates to multiple sites forming the basis of polyspecificity. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Zanger<br>\n<br>\n Since over 50 years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is in use as backbone of chemotherapy treatment regimens for a wide range of cancers including colon, breast, and head and neck carcinomas. However, drug resistance and severe toxicities such as mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and vomiting in up to 40% of treated patients often lead to dose limitation or treatment discontinuation. Because the oral bioavailability of 5-FU is unpredictable and highly variable, 5-FU is commonly administered intravenously. To overcome medical complications and inconvenience associated with intravenous administration, the oral prodrugs capecitabine and tegafur have been developed. Both fluoropyrimidines are metabolically converted intracellularly to 5-FU, which then needs metabolic activation to exert its damaging activity on RNA and DNA. The low response rates of 10\u201315% of 5-FU monotherapy can be improved by combination regimens of infusional 5-FU and leucovorin together with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI), thereby increasing response rates to 30\u201340%. The impact of metabolizing enzymes in the development of fluoropyrimidine toxicity and resistance has been studied in great detail. In addition, membrane drug transporters, which are critical determinants of intracellular drug concentrations, may play a role in occurrence of toxicity and development of resistance against fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as well. This review therefore summarizes current knowledge on the role of drug transporters with particular focus on ATP-binding cassette transporters in fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy response. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

                "abstract": "Publication date: Available online 8 January 2015<br>\n Source:Advances in Cancer Research<br>\n     Author(s): Toshihisa  Ishikawa , Yoshinaga  Kajimoto , Yutaka  Inoue , Yoji  Ikegami , Toshihiko  Kuroiwa<br>\n<br>\n Primary brain tumors occur in around 250,000 people per year globally. Survival rates in primary brain tumors depend on the type of tumor, patient's age, the extent of surgical tumor removal, and other factors. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is a practical tool currently used in surgical operation of aggressive brain tumors, such as glioblastoma and meningiomas, whereas clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to brain tumor therapy has just recently started. Both PDD and PDT are achieved by a photon-induced physicochemical reaction, which is induced by the excitation of porphyrins exposed to light. In fluorescence-guided gross-total resection, PDD can be achieved by the administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) as the precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Exogenously administered ALA induces biosynthesis and accumulation of PpIX, a natural photosensitizer, in cancer cells. However, ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 plays a critical role in regulating the cellular accumulation of porphyrins in cancer cells and thereby its expression and function can affect the efficacy of PDD and PDT. In response to the photoreaction of porphyrins leading to oxidative stress, the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related transcription factor can transcriptionally upregulate ABCG2, which may reduce the efficacy of PDD and PDT. On the other hand, certain protein kinase inhibitors potentially enhance the efficacy of PDD and PDT by blocking ABCG2-mediated porphyrin efflux from cancer cells. In this context, it is of great interest to develop ABCG2 inhibitors that can be applied to PDD or PDT for the therapy of brain tumor and other tumors. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Cummings<br>\n<br>\n Mucin-type O-glycans are a class of glycans initiated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) \u03b1-linked primarily to Ser/Thr residues within glycoproteins and often extended or branched by sugars or saccharides. Most secretory and membrane-bound proteins receive this modification, which is important in regulating many biological processes. Alterations in mucin-type O-glycans have been described across tumor types and include expression of relatively small-sized, truncated O-glycans and altered terminal structures, both of which are associated with patient prognosis. New discoveries in the identity and expression of tumor-associated O-glycans are providing new avenues for tumor detection and treatment. This chapter describes mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis, altered mucin-type O-glycans in primary tumors, including mechanisms for structural changes and contributions to the tumor phenotype, and clinical approaches to detect and target altered O-glycans for cancer treatment and management. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The prostate functions as a major secretory gland for the production of glycoproteins critical to sperm activation and reproduction. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), produced by the prostate, is one of the most commonly assayed glycoproteins in blood, serving as a biomarker for early detection and progression of prostate cancer. The single site of N-glycosylation on PSA has been the target of multiple glycan characterization studies. In this review, the extensive number of studies that have characterized the changes in O-linked and N-linked glycosylations associated with prostate cancer development and progression will be summarized. This includes analysis of the glycosylation of PSA, and other prostate glycoproteins, in tissues, clinical biofluids, and cell line models. Other studies are summarized in the context of understanding the complexities of these glycan changes in order to address the many confounding questions associated with prostate cancer, as well as efforts to improve prostate cancer biomarker assays using targeted glycomic-based strategies. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

To address this challenge, studies have been conducted to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving Btz resistance and to discover new targeted therapeutic strategies and combinations that restore Btz activity. This review discusses the literature describing molecular adaptations that confer Btz resistance with a primary disease focus on MM.

                "abstract": "Publication date: Available online 29 March 2015<br>\n Source:Advances in Cancer Research<br>\n     Author(s): Sarah K.  Martin , Natasha  Kyprianou<br>\n<br>\n Prostate cancer is a tumor addicted to androgen receptor (AR) signaling, even in its castration resistant state, and recently developed antiandrogen therapies including Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide effectively target the androgen signaling axis, but there is ultimately recurrence to lethal disease. Development of advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a biological consequence of lack of an apoptotic response of prostate tumor cells to androgen ablation. Taxanes represent the major clinically relevant chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC; unfortunately, they do not deliver a cure but an extension of overall survival. First-generation taxane chemotherapies, Docetaxel (Taxotere), effectively target the cytoskeleton by stabilizing the interaction of \u03b2-tubulin subunits of microtubules preventing depolymerization, inducing G2M arrest and apoptosis. Shifting the current paradigm is a growing evidence to indicate that Docetaxel can effectively target the AR signaling axis by blocking its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, implicating a new mechanism of cross-resistance between microtubule-targeting chemotherapy and antiandrogen therapies. More recently, Cabazitaxel has emerged as a second-line taxane chemotherapy capable of conferring additional survival benefit to patients with CRPC previously treated with Docetaxel or in combination with antiandrogens. Similar to Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel induces apoptosis and G2M arrest; in contrast to Docetaxel, it sustains AR nuclear accumulation although it reduces the overall AR levels and FOXO1 expression. Cabazitaxel treatment also leads to downregulation of the microtubule-depolymerizing mitotic kinesins, MCAK, and HSET, preventing their ability to depolymerize microtubules and thus enhancing sensitivity to taxane treatment. The molecular mechanisms underlying taxane resistance involve mutational alterations in the tubulin subunits, microtubule dynamics, phenotyping programming of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition landscape, and the status of AR activity. This chapter discusses the mechanisms driving the therapeutic resistance of taxanes and antiandrogen therapies in CRPC, and the role of AR in potential interventions toward overcoming such resistance in patients with advanced metastatic disease. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

                "abstract": "Background:\nTumor-induced lymphangiogenesis plays a crucial role in metastasis and tumor progression. However, the significance of intratumoral lymphovascular density (I-LVD) and peritumoral lymphovascular density (P-LVD) has been controversial in gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences of clinicopathologic characteristics with respect to I-LVD and P-LVD in gastric cancer.\nMethods:\nSamples of I-LVD and P-LVD from 66 patients who had undergone radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer were assessed after staining with D2-40, an immunostaining marker for lymphatic endothelium. The mean number of lymphatic vessels in three hotspots was calculated in intratumoral and peritumoral areas.\nResults:\nThe peritumoral lymphatics were enlarged with dilated lumens compared to the intratumoral lymphatics. I-LVD was positively correlated with diffuse gastric cancer subtype, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, tumor node metastasis stage, and overall survival (P <0.05). P-LVD was associated with lymphovascular invasion, node stage, and disease-free survival (P <0.05).\nConclusions:\nWe conclude that P-LVD had an important role in lymph node metastasis, while I-LVD was more associated with depth of tumor invasion. However, both LVDs contributed to gastric cancer progression and prognosis.",

                "abstract": "Background:\nSurvival from cancer is worse in England than in some European countries. To improve survival, strategies in England have focused on early presentation (reducing delay to improve stage at diagnosis), improving quality of care and ensuring equity throughout the patient pathway. We assessed whether primary care characteristics were associated with later stage cancer at diagnosis (stages 3/4 versus 1/2) for female breast, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer.\nMethods:\nData obtained from the National Cancer Registration Service, Quality Outcomes Framework, GP survey and GP workforce census, linked by practice code. Risk differences (RD) were calculated by primary care characteristics using a generalised linear model, accounting for patient clustering within practices. Models were adjusted for age, sex and an area-based deprivation measure.\nResults:\nFor female breast cancer, being with a practice with a higher two week wait (TWW) referral rate (RD \u22121.8\u00a0% (95 % CI \u22120.5\u00a0% to \u22123.2\u00a0%) p\u2009=\u20090.003) and a higher TWW detection rate (RD \u22121.7\u00a0% (95 % CI \u22120.3\u00a0% to \u22123.0\u00a0%) p\u2009=\u20090.003) was associated with a lower proportion diagnosed later. Being at a practice where people thought it less easy to book at appointment was associated with a higher percentage diagnosed later (RD 1.8\u00a0% (95 % CI 0.2\u00a0% to 3.4\u00a0%) p\u2009=\u20090.03). For lung cancer, being at practices with higher TWW referral rates was associated with lower proportion advanced (RD-3.6\u00a0% (95 % CI \u22121.8\u00a0%, \u22125.5\u00a0%) p\u2009<\u20090.001) whereas being at practices with more patients per GP was associated with higher proportion advanced (RD1.8\u00a0% (95 % CI 0.2, 3.4) p\u2009=\u20090.01). A higher rate of gastrointestinal investigations was associated with a lower proportion of later stage colorectal cancers (RD \u22122.0\u00a0% (95 % CI \u22120.6\u00a0% to \u22123.6\u00a0%) p\u2009=\u20090.01). No organisational characteristics were associated with prostate cancer stage.\nConclusion:\nEasier access to primary care, faster referral and more investigation for gastrointestinal symptoms could reduce the proportion of people diagnosed later for female breast, lung and colorectal, but not prostate cancer. Differences between the four main cancers suggest different policies may be required for individual cancers to improve outcomes.",

ATP-binding cassette subfamily G2 (ABCG2) regulates endogenous protoporphyrin levels. In human colon cancers, it is not fully examined the role of ABCG2 in porphyrin-based photodynamic therapy.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nSW480 and HT29 cells were selected because they showed low and high ABCG2 expression levels, respectively. Pyropheophorbid-a (PPa) was used as a photosensitizer. Cells were exposed to a 670\u00a0nm diod laser. Cell viability and necrosi apoptosis was examined. Production level of singlet oxygen was detected with the photomultiplier-tube s/ -based singlet oxygen detection system.<br>\nResults:<br>\nSW480 cells, which expressed lower level of ABCG2, showed the higher uptake of PPa than HT-29 cells. The uptake level of PPa was significantly correlated with the decreased cell viability after PDT. Pretreatment with a ABCG2 inhibitor, Ko-143, significantly enhanced the PDT efficacy in HT29 cells compared to vehicle-pretreated cells. To confirm the ABCG2 effect on PDT, we established ABCG2 over-expressing stable cells in SW480 cells (SW480/ABCG2). Furthermore, SW480/ABCG2 cells showed significantly decreased PDT effect compared to the control cells. The increased or decreased cell survival was significantly correlated with the production level of singlet oxygen after PDT.<br>\nConclusion:<br>\nABCG2 plays an important role in determining the PDT efficacy by controlling the photosensitizer efflux rate. This implies the control of ABCG2 expression may be a potential solution to enhance photosensitivity.",

These effects are well studied in standardized settings. The question of transferring these skills into clinical consultations remains open. We build up on a previous developed training concept consisting of a workshop and coaching. This training achieved a medium effect size in two studies with standardized patients. In the current study, we expanded and manualized the coaching concept, and we will evaluate effects of a varied number of coaching sessions on real clinical consultations. Our aim is to determine how much coaching oncologists need to transfer communication skills into clinical practice.Methods/designPhysicians of two German medical centers will participate in a workshop for communication skills and will be randomized to either a group with one coaching session or a group with four coaching sessions following the workshop. The participation is voluntary and the physicians will receive medical education points. Consultations held by the participating physicians with actual patients who gave their informed consent will be filmed at three time points. These consultations will be evaluated by blinded raters using a checklist based on the training content (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will be the self-evaluated communication competence by physicians and an evaluation of the consultations by both physicians and patients.DiscussionWe will evaluate our communication training concept on three levels \u2013 rater, physician and patient \u2013 and concentrate on the transfer of communication skills into real life situations.As we emphasize the external validity in this study design, limitations will be expected due to heterogeneity of data.

We evaluated the association between arthralgia, co-morbid fatigue/insomnia and inflammatory biomarkers among women taking AIs.\nMethods:\nWomen taking AIs for early stage breast cancer completed a modified version of the Brief Pain Inventory, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index, and provided blood samples for simultaneous assessment of 34 inflammatory biomarkers using a Luminex kit. Two-sided t-tests were used to compare inflammatory biomarker concentrations for patients with or without moderate to severe arthralgia. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between comorbid arthralgia, fatigue and insomnia with identified biomarker concentrations.\nResults:\nAmong 203 participants, severity of arthralgia, fatigue and insomnia significantly correlated with each other (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all comparisons). After controlling for race, chemotherapy history, NSAID use, age and BMI, the co-existence of arthralgia, fatigue and insomnia was associated with elevated CRP (\u03b2 93.1, 95\u00a0% Confidence Interval (CI) [25.1, 161.1], p\u2009=\u20090.008), Eotaxin (\u03b2 79.9, 95\u00a0% CI [32.5, 127.2], p\u2009=\u20090.001), MCP-1 (\u03b2 151.2, 95\u00a0% CI [32.7, 269.8], p\u2009=\u20090.013), and VDBP (\u03b2 19422, 95\u00a0% CI [5500.5, 33344], p\u2009=\u20090.006).\nConclusion:\nAmong women taking AIs, the co-existence of arthralgia, fatigue and insomnia was associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers (elevated CRP, Eotaxin, MCP-1 and VDBP).

Whereas some lesions are cured by local surgical excision, others recur as in situ disease or progress to invasive carcinoma with subsequent potential for metastatic spread. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are therefore desirable for appropriate clinical management but remain elusive. In common with invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ exhibits many genomic changes, predominantly copy number alterations. Although studies have revealed the genomic heterogeneity within individual ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and the association of certain copy number alterations with nuclear grade, none of the genomic changes defined so far is consistently associated with invasive transformation or recurrence risk in pure ductal carcinoma in situ. This article will review the current landscape of genomic alterations in ductal carcinoma in situ and their potential as prognostic biomarkers together with the technologies used to define these.",

Family history of BC is considered one of the strongest risk factors for BCIS.\nMethods:\nTo evaluate the association of BC susceptibility loci with BCIS risk, we genotyped 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with risk of invasive BC, in 1317 BCIS cases, 10,645 invasive BC cases, and 14,006 healthy controls in the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). Using unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for age and study, we estimated the association of SNPs with BCIS using two different comparison groups: healthy controls and invasive BC subjects to investigate whether BCIS and BC share a common genetic profile.\nResults:\nWe found that five SNPs (CDKN2BAS-rs1011970, FGFR2-rs3750817, FGFR2-rs2981582 TNRC9-rs3803662, 5p12-rs10941679) were significantly associated with BCIS risk (p-value adjusted for multiple comparisons <0.0016). Comparing invasive BC and BCIS, the largest difference was for CDKN2BAS-rs1011970 which showed a positive association with BCIS (OR\u2009=\u20091.24, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.11-1.38, P\u2009=\u20091.27x10\u22124) and no association with invasive BC (OR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.99-1.07, P\u2009=\u20090.06), with a p-value for case-case comparison of 0.006. Subgroup analyses investigating associations with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) found similar associations, albeit less significant (OR\u2009=\u20091.25, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.09-1.42, P\u2009=\u20091.07x10\u22123). Additional risk analyses showed significant associations with invasive disease at the 0.05-level for 28 of the alleles and the OR estimates were consistent with those reported by other studies.\nConclusions:\nOur study adds to the knowledge that several of the known BC susceptibility loci are risk factors for both BCIS and invasive BC, with the possible exception of rs1011970, a putatively functional SNP situated in the CDKN2BAS gene that may be a specific BCIS susceptibility locus.",

                "abstract": "IntroductionChemotherapy remains the only available treatment for triple-negative (TN) breast cancer, and most patients exhibit an incomplete pathologic response. Half of patients exhibiting an incomplete pathologic response die within five years of treatment due to chemo-resistant, recurrent tumor growth. Defining molecules responsible for TN breast cancer chemo-resistance is crucial for developing effective combination therapies blocking tumor recurrence. Historically, chemo-resistance studies have relied on long-term chemotherapy selection models that drive genetic mutations conferring cell survival. Other models suggest that tumors are heterogeneous, being composed of both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant tumor cell populations. We previously described a short-term chemotherapy treatment model that enriches for chemo-residual TN tumor cells. In the current work, we use this enrichment strategy to identify a novel determinant of TN breast cancer chemotherapy resistance [a nuclear isoform of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)].<br>\nMethods:<br>\nStudies are conducted using our in vitro model of chemotherapy resistance. Short-term chemotherapy treatment enriches for a chemo-residual TN subpopulation that over time resumes proliferation. By western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, we show that this chemotherapy-enriched tumor cell subpopulation expresses nuclear bFGF. The importance of bFGF for survival of these chemo-residual cells is interrogated using short hairpin knockdown strategies. DNA repair capability is assessed by comet assay. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to determine nuclear bFGF expression in TN breast cancer cases pre- and post- neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<br>\nResults:<br>\nTN tumor cells surviving short-term chemotherapy treatment express increased nuclear bFGF. bFGF knockdown reduces the number of chemo-residual TN tumor cells. Adding back a nuclear bFGF construct to bFGF knockdown cells restores their chemo-resistance. Nuclear bFGF-mediated chemo-resistance is associated with increased DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) expression and accelerated DNA repair. In fifty-six percent of matched TN breast cancer cases, percent nuclear bFGF-positive tumor cells either increases or remains the same post- neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (compared to pre-treatment). These data indicate that in a subset of TN breast cancers, chemotherapy enriches for nuclear bFGF-expressing tumor cells.<br>\nConclusion:<br>\nThese studies identify nuclear bFGF as a protein in a subset of TN breast cancers that likely contributes to drug resistance following standard chemotherapy treatment.",

We previously used analysis of mammary morphogenesis to discover a critical role for GATA-3 in mammary developmental and carcinogenesis. In recent years an important role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in a myriad of cellular processes in development and in oncogenesis has emerged.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nmicroRNA profiling was conducted on stromal and epithelial cellular subsets microdissected from the pubertal mouse mammary gland. miR-184 was reactivated by transient or stable overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and examined using a series of in vitro (proliferation, tumour-sphere and protein synthesis) assays. Orthotopic xenografts of breast cancer cells were used to assess the effect of miR-184 on tumourigenesis as well as distant metastasis. Interactions between miR-184 and its putative targets were assessed by quantitative PCR, microarray, bioinformatics and 3\u2032 untranslated region Luciferase reporter assay.The methylation status of primary patient samples was determined by MBD-Cap sequencing. Lastly, the clinical prognostic significance of miR-184 putative targets was assessed using publicly available datasets.<br>\nResults:<br>\nA large number of microRNA were restricted in their expression to specific tissue subsets. MicroRNA-184 (miR-184) was exclusively expressed in epithelial cells and markedly upregulated during differentiation of the proliferative, invasive cells of the pubertal terminal end bud (TEB) into ductal epithelial cells in vivo. miR-184 expression was silenced in mouse tumour models compared to non-transformed epithelium and in a majority of breast cancer cell line models. Ectopic reactivation of miR-184 inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and delayed primary tumour formation and reduced metastatic burden in vivo. Gene expression studies uncovered multi-factorial regulation of genes in the AKT/mTORC1 pathway by miR-184. In clinical breast cancer tissues, expression of miR-184 is lost in primary TNBCs while the miR-184 promoter is methylated in a subset of lymph node metastases from TNBC patients.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nThese studies elucidate a new layer of regulation in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with relevance to mammary development and tumour progression and identify miR-184 as a putative breast tumour suppressor.",

But its mechanism of action in the clinical arena remains elusive. In a window of opportunity trial of metformin in non-diabetic breast cancer patients, Dowling and colleagues examined both the direct actions of the drug on cancer cells (as mediated by AMP kinase), as well as its indirect actions (as mediated by circulating insulin). The data suggest that short-term administration of metformin in this setting has anti-tumor effects significantly involving the indirect, insulin-dependent pathway. The role of the direct pathway remains to be determined. This study represents an important step forward in establishing one of several possible mechanisms for metformin, information that will be useful in determining candidate biomarkers to evaluate in large clinical trials of metformin, such as the ongoing NCIC CTG MA.32 trial of adjuvant metformin. The potential significance of these data for metformin in the treatment of breast cancer is discussed here.",

We have determined the global miRNA expression profiles of functionally distinct epithelial subpopulations in mouse and human mammary tissue, and compared these to their cognate transcriptomes and epigenomes. Finally, the human miRNA signatures were used to interrogate the different subtypes of breast cancer, with a view to determining miRNA networks deregulated during oncogenesis.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nRNA from sorted mouse and human mammary cell subpopulations was subjected to miRNA expression analysis using the TaqMan MicroRNA Array. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were correlated with gene expression and histone methylation profiles. Analysis of miRNA signatures of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer in the TCGA database versus those of normal human epithelial subpopulations was performed.<br>\nResults:<br>\nUnique miRNA signatures characterized each subset (MaSC/basal, luminal progenitor, mature luminal, stromal), with a high degree of conservation across species. Comparison of miRNA and transcriptome profiles for the epithelial subtypes revealed an inverse relationship and pinpointed key developmental genes. Interestingly, expression of the primate-specific miRNA cluster (19q13.4) was found to be restricted to the MaSC/basal subset. Comparative analysis of miRNA signatures with H3 lysine modification maps of the different epithelial subsets revealed a tight correlation between active or repressive marks for the top DE miRNAs, including derepression of miRNAs in Ezh2-deficient cellular subsets. Interrogation of TCGA-identified miRNA profiles with the miRNA signatures of different human subsets revealed specific relationships.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nThe derivation of global miRNA expression profiles for the different mammary subpopulations provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the interplay between miRNA networks and target gene expression. These data have highlighted lineage-specific miRNAs and potential miRNA-mRNA networks, some of which are disrupted in neoplasia. Furthermore, our findings suggest that key developmental miRNAs are regulated by global changes in histone modification, thus linking the mammary epigenome with genome-wide changes in the expression of genes and miRNAs. Comparative miRNA signature analyses between normal breast epithelial cells and breast tumors confirmed an important linkage between luminal progenitor cells and basal-like tumors.",

Moreover, lower expression of PDCD4 was significantly associated with HER2 positive status in ER-positive breast tumors. Down-regulation of PDCD4 was mediated through up-regulation of HER2 via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), and miR-21 in AI-resistant breast cancer cells. MiR-21 inhibitor and the ER down-regulator\u00a0fulvestrant induced PDCD4 expression and decreased cell proliferation in AI-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, forced overexpression of PDCD4 resensitized AI-resistant cells to AI or hormone deprivation. Finally, we identified that down-regulation of PDCD4 was associated with a lower rate of disease-free survival in patients with\u00a0ER-positive breast cancer and high histologic grade of breast tumors. In summary, our study shows that\u00a0expression of PDCD4 is down-regulated by HER2 signaling in AI-resistant breast cancer. Down-regulation of PDCD4 is associated with AI resistance and a poor prognosis in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.</p>",

We examined circadian variation in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics in mice and breast cancer patients. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in mice, dosed at six different times (24-h period). Tissue samples were used for mRNA expression analysis of drug-metabolizing enzymes. In patients, a cross-over study was performed. During three 24-h periods, after tamoxifen dosing at 8 a.m., 1 p.m., and 8 p.m., for at least 4\u00a0weeks, blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic measurements. Differences in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics between administration times were assessed. The mRNA expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes showed circadian variation in mouse tissues. Tamoxifen exposure seemed to be highest after administration at midnight. In humans, marginal differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between morning and evening administration.

The results suggest that dosing time is of marginal influence on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics. Our study was not designed to detect potential changes in clinical outcome or toxicity, based on a difference in the time of administration. Circadian rhythm may be one of the many determinants of the interpatient and intrapatient pharmacokinetic variability of tamoxifen.</p>",

However, experimental systems to study the processes that lead to specific, recurrent amplification events in human cancers are lacking. Moreover, some common amplifications, such as that at 8p11-12 in breast cancer, harbor multiple driver oncogenes, which are poorly modeled by conventional overexpression approaches. We sought to develop an experimental system to model recurrent chromosomal amplification events in human cell lines. Our strategy is to use homologous-recombination-mediated gene targeting to deliver a dominantly selectable, amplifiable marker to a specified chromosomal location. We used adeno-associated virus vectors to target human MCF-7 breast cancer cells at the <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>ZNF703</em> locus, in the recurrent 8p11-12 amplicon, using the <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>E</em>. <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>coli</em> inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) enzyme as a marker. We applied selective pressure using IMPDH inhibitors.

Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed that amplifications had occurred on the short arm of chromosome 8, without changes on 8q or other chromosomes. Patterns of amplification were variable and similar to those seen in primary human breast cancers, including \u201csawtooth\u201d patterns, distal copy number loss, and large continuous regions of copy number gain. This system will allow study of the cis- and trans-acting factors that are permissive for chromosomal amplification and provide a model to analyze oncogene cooperativity in amplifications harboring multiple candidate driver genes.</p>",

We calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) of potentially modifiable risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer in Dutch women aged\u00a0&gt;50 in 2010. First, age-specific PAFs were calculated for each risk factor, based on their relative risks for postmenopausal breast cancer (from meta-analyses) and age-specific prevalence in the population (from national surveys) around the year 2000, assuming a latency period of 10\u00a0years. To obtain the overall PAF, age-specific PAFs were summed in a weighted manner, using the age-specific breast cancer incidence rates (2010) as weights. 95\u00a0% confidence intervals for PAF estimates were derived by Monte Carlo simulations. Of Dutch women\u00a0&gt;40\u00a0years, in 2000, 51\u00a0% were overweight/obese, 55\u00a0% physically inactive (&lt;5\u00a0days/week 30\u00a0min activity), 75\u00a0% regularly consumed alcohol, 42\u00a0% ever smoked cigarettes and 79\u00a0% had a low-fibre intake (&lt;3.4\u00a0g/1000\u00a0kJ/day). These factors combined had a PAF of 25.7\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 24.2\u201327.2), corresponding to 2,665 Dutch postmenopausal breast cancer cases in 2010. PAFs were 8.8\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 6.3\u201311.3) for overweight/obesity, 6.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 5.2\u20138.0) for alcohol consumption, 5.5\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 4.0\u20137.0) for physical inactivity, 4.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 3.3\u20136.0) for smoking and 3.2\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 1.6\u20134.8) for low-fibre intake. Our findings imply that modifiable risk factors are jointly responsible for approximately one out of four Dutch postmenopausal breast cancer cases. This suggests that incidence rates can be lowered substantially by living a more healthy lifestyle.</p>",

The purpose of this study was to assess ACT occurrence and clinical and genetic risk factors in early breast cancer patients. In 6 genes of interest (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>ABCC1</em>, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>ABCC2</em>, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>CYBA</em>, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>NCF4</em>, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>RAC2</em>, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>SLC28A3</em>), 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in ACT were selected based on a literature search. Eight hundred and seventy-seven patients treated between 2000 and 2010 with 3\u20136 cycles of (neo) adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) were genotyped for these SNPs using Sequenom MassARRAY. Main outcome measures were asymptomatic decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\u00a0&gt;\u00a010\u00a0% and cardiac failure grade 3\u20135 (CTCAE 4.0). To evaluate the impact of these 10 SNPs as well as clinical factors (age, relative dose intensity of epirubicin, left-sided radiotherapy, occurrence of febrile neutropenia, and planned and received cycles of epirubicin) on decrease of LVEF and cardiac failure, we performed uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Additionally, exploratory analyses including 11 additional SNPs related to the metabolism of anthracyclines were performed. After a median follow-up of 3.62\u00a0years (range 0.40\u20139.60), a LVEF decline of\u00a0&gt;\u00a010\u00a0% occurred in 153 patients (17.5\u00a0%) and cardiac failure in 16 patients (1.8\u00a0%). In multivariable analysis, six cycles of FEC compared to three cycles received and heterozygous carriers of the rs246221 T-allele in <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>ABCC1</em> relative to homozygous carriers of the T-allele were significantly associated with LVEF decline of\u00a0&gt;\u00a010\u00a0% (OR 1.3, 95\u00a0% CI 1.1\u20131.4, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001 and OR 1.6, 95\u00a0% CI 1.1\u20132.3, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

The other 9 SNPs and clinical factors tested were not significantly associated. In our exploratory analysis, no other SNPs related to anthracycline metabolism were retained in the multivariate model for prediction of LVEF decline. ACT in breast cancer patients is related to number of received cycles of epirubicin and left-sided radiotherapy.

A systematic search was carried out using PubMed and Medline. We searched for articles containing epidemiological evidence of breast cancer following thyroid cancer and vice versa. Additionally, we searched for articles that included epidemiological data involving the incidence of all second primary malignancies (SPMs) following both breast cancer and thyroid cancer, and compared the datasets. The meta-analysis performed in a total of 18 studies showed that there is a significantly increased risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer (SIR\u00a0=\u00a01.59, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 1.28\u20131.99). Additionally, there was marginally increased risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer (SIR\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 95\u00a0% CI 1.16\u20131.33), compared to the general risk of developing a second primary malignancy following thyroid cancer. The findings suggest that the risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer and vice versa is increased compared to the background risk of developing other SPMs. The risk of developing thyroid cancer after a primary breast cancer was higher than the risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer. This suggests that the effects of treatment-related factors and specific pathological processes of each cancer may contribute to the increased risk rather than common risk factors including genetic factors. Elucidation of the common mechanisms between breast cancer and thyroid cancer will have important implications in both diagnostic and therapeutic management of these cancers. Benefit of thyroid ultrasound screening after breast cancer surgery needs to be assessed.</p>",

In addition we have generated mesenchymal transformed MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7-EMT), showing significantly increased invasion in contrast to wild type MCF-7 cells (MCF-7 WT). In this study we have analyzed whether stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is responsible for MCF-7 and T-47-D breast cancer cell invasion and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal-transition (EMT). In addition we have analyzed whether kisspeptin-10 (KP-10) treatment affects SDF-1-induced invasion and EMT. Invasion was quantified by assessment of MCF-7 and T-47-D breast cancer cell migration rate through an artificial basement membrane in a modified Boyden chamber during co-culture with MG63 cells or after treatment with SDF-1\u03b1, SDF-1\u03b2 or the combination of both isoforms. Induction of EMT was verified by analysis of protein expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1) and mesenchymal markers N-cadherin (CDH2) and Vimentin (VIM). The role of SDF-1 for invasion and induction of EMT in breast cancer cells was analyzed by blocking SDF-1 secretion during co-culture with MG63 cells. In addition effects of KP-10 treatment on SDF-1-induced invasion and EMT were analyzed. Breast cancer cell invasion was significantly increased when co-cultured with MG63 cells. During co-culture SDF-1 protein expression of MG63 cells was significantly induced. The increased breast cancer cell invasion could be blocked by anti-SDF-1 antibodies. Treatment of breast cancer cells in monoculture (without MG63) with SDF-1\u03b1, SDF-1\u03b2 or the combination of both isoforms resulted in a significant escalation of breast cancer cell invasion and induction of EMT. Protein expression of mesenchymal markers CDH2 and VIM was clearly elevated, whereas protein expression of epithelial marker CDH1 was clearly decreased. The SDF-1-induced increase of cell invasion was significantly reduced after treatment with KP-10. In addition, induction of EMT was inhibited. Furthermore, protein expression of the binding site of SDF-1, CXC-motive-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4), was reduced by KP-10. Treatment of MCF-7-EMT cells with KP-10 resulted in a significant drop of cell invasion and CXCR-4 protein expression. Our findings suggest that SDF-1 plays a major role in breast cancer invasion and EMT. SDF-1-induced invasion and EMT can be inhibited by KP-10 treatment by down-regulating CXCR-4 expression.</p>",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether circulating HOTAIR can be used for breast cancer diagnosis. HOTAIR in serum was measured by PCR-based direct detection. Reverse transcriptase and DNase I treatment were used to distinguish the DNA and RNA forms of HOTAIR. To determine whether circulating HOTAIR is a biomarker for breast cancer, the DNA of HOTAIR from breast cancer patients and healthy controls was measured at both the discovery stage (48 individuals) and an independent validation stage (156 individuals). The diagnostic accuracy was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). We showed that the major form of HOTAIR-derived fragment in serum is DNA rather than RNA in our study, the same as for MALAT-1, another well-described lincRNA. A higher circulating DNA level of HOTAIR was found in patients at the discovery stage (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). ROC analysis revealed that the circulating HOTAIR DNA distinguished breast cancer patients from healthy individuals (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.799). This finding was confirmed at the validation stage. Though circulating MALAT-1 DNA was altered in the discovery stage, it showed no significant difference in the validation stage.

As a result, tumor-positive margins, which require additional treatment, are not found until histopathologic evaluation. With diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), tissue can be characterized during surgery based on optical parameters that are related to the tissue morphology and composition. Here we investigate which optical parameters are able to detect tumor in an area with a mixture of benign and tumor tissue and hence which parameters are most suitable for intra-operative margin assessment. DRS spectra (400\u20131600\u00a0nm) were obtained from 16 ex vivo lumpectomy specimens from benign, tumor border, and tumor tissue. One mastectomy specimen was used with a custom-made grid for validation purposes. The optical parameter related to the absorption of fat and water (F/W-ratio) in the extended near-infrared wavelength region (~1000\u20131600\u00a0nm) provided the best discrimination between benign and tumor sites resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 100\u00a0% (excluding the border sites). Per patient, the scaled F/W-ratio gradually decreased from grossly benign tissue towards the tumor in 87.5\u00a0% of the specimens. In one test case, based on a predefined F/W-ratio for boundary tissue of 0.58, DRS produced a surgical resection plane that nearly overlapped with a 2-mm rim of benign tissue, 2\u00a0mm being the most widely accepted definition of a negative margin. The F/W-ratio provided excellent discrimination between sites clearly inside or outside the tumor and was able to detect the border of the tumor in one test case.

One mechanism by which HER2 may mediate resistance is through expansion of the tumor initiating cell (TIC) population. This study investigates whether combining all-<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>trans</em> retinoic acid (ATRA) and histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat (ENT) can inhibit TICs and HER2 in AI-resistant cells and tumors. Modulation of cell viability and HER2 expression were assessed in AI-resistant cells treated with ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0ENT. Letrozole-resistant LTLT-Ca cells treated with ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0ENT were assayed for changes in TIC characteristics, such as TIC markers (BCRP, ALDH, and BMI-1), side population (SP), and mammosphere formation. Xenograft tumors of MCF-7Ca cells made resistant to letrozole were treated with ATRA, ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0letrozole, ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0ENT, or ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0ENT\u00a0+\u00a0letrozole. Resulting tumors were assayed for changes in TIC characteristics. Patient samples taken pre- and post-AI treatment were analyzed for changes in ER\u03b1 and HER2 protein expression. Treatment with ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0ENT reduced HER2 expression and viability (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) in AI-resistant cells, as well as decreased SP (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001), mammosphere formation (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01), and expression of TIC molecular markers (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01) in LTLT-Ca. A reduction in tumor growth rate was observed in mice treated with ENT\u00a0+\u00a0ATRA\u00a0+\u00a0letrozole when compared to mice treated with single agents (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) or ENT\u00a0+\u00a0ATRA (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Decreased TIC characteristics, including mammosphere formation (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05), were observed in tumors from the triple combination. An increase in HER2 and downregulation in ER\u03b1 protein expression was observed in patients upon resistance to AI (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.005). These studies indicate that the combination of ATRA and ENT inhibits the TIC population of AI-resistant cells and may be effective in reducing tumor recurrence.</p>",

This retrospective German multicenter study included 9061 patients with primary breast cancer recruited from 1991 to 2009. We formed subgroups for the time intervals 1991\u20132000 (TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>1</sub>) and 2001\u20132009 (TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sub>). In these subgroups, the risk of recurrence (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients whose treatment was either 100\u00a0% guideline-conforming or, respectively, non-guideline-conforming. The clinical outcome of all patients significantly improved in TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sub> compared to TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>1</sub> [RFS: <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.57, 95\u00a0% CI (0.49\u20130.67); OS: <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95\u00a0% (CI 0.66\u20130.87)]. OS and RFS of guideline non-adherent patients also improved in TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sub> compared to TI. Comparing risk profiles, determined by Nottingham Prognostic Score reveals a significant (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0=\u00a00.001) enhancement in the time cohort TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sub>. Furthermore, the percentage of guideline-conforming systemic therapy (endocrine therapy and chemotherapy) significantly increased (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>p</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) in the time cohort TI<sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sub> to TI for the non-adherent group. The general improvement of clinical outcome of patients during the last 20\u00a0years is also valid in the subgroup of women who received treatments, which deviated from the guidelines. The shift in risk profiles as well as medical advances are major reasons for this improvement. Nevertheless, patients with 100\u00a0% guideline-conforming therapy always had a better outcome compared to patients with guideline non-adherent therapy.</p>",

Hot flash symptoms, described as intense sensations of heat, sweating and flushing occur in more than 50\u00a0% of breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen. We hypothesized that venlafaxine, a selective-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor drug, was effective for reducing patient-reported hot flash scores among women treated for breast cancer compared to other non-hormonal treatments. We searched Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception till May 2015 for venlafaxine (75\u00a0mg once daily or greater) with non-hormonal comparators for the treatment of hot flashes in female breast cancer patients. The primary outcome was hot flash score (derived from patient-reported hot flash severity and frequency) in randomized controlled trials. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each study due to variation in the outcome measures. Heterogeneity was determined using <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>I</em>\n                              <sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sup> statistics, and publication bias was assessed using a contour funnel plot and Egger\u2019s tests. Pooled analyses demonstrated that venlafaxine significantly reduced hot flash scores compared to the trial comparators (overall SMD 2.06; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) [0.40, 3.72]). There was significant heterogeneity among these studies (<em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>I</em>\n                              <sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a098.7\u00a0%, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001). Asymmetry in the contour funnel plot suggests the presence of publication bias and a trend towards small study effects (Egger\u2019s test, <em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;>P</em>\u00a0=\u00a00.096). Venlafaxine is efficacious in managing hot flashes among women with breast cancer. This review highlights methodological issues that arise from eligible trials and recommends a collaborative approach in survivorship studies.</p>",

Demographic and clinical characteristics, initial treatment patterns, and survival outcomes were evaluated using surveillance epidemiology statistical methods.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRESULTS<br>\nThe average annual age\u2010adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 population was 7.62 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 7.55\u20107.68) for all meningiomas, 7.18 (95% CI, 7.12\u20107.25) for benign meningiomas, 0.32 (95% CI, 0.31\u20100.33) for borderline malignant meningiomas, and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.11\u20100.12) for malignant meningiomas. The annual rates increased for benign and borderline malignant tumors but decreased for malignant tumors. The rates for women exceeded those for men, especially for those with benign meningiomas. Black race was associated with significantly higher rates as was advancing age. Greater than 80% of tumors were located in cerebral meninges. Diagnostic confirmation through pathology occurred for approximately 50% of benign tumors, 90% of borderline malignant tumors, and 80% of malignant tumors. No initial treatment was reported for greater than 60% of benign tumors, 29% of borderline malignant tumors, or 31% of malignant tumors. The 5\u2010year relative survival estimates for benign tumors, borderline malignant tumors, and malignant tumors were 85.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85%\u201086.2%), 82.3% (95% CI, 79.3%\u201084.8%), and 66% (95% CI, 60.6%\u201070.9%), respectively.

Health\u2010related quality\u2010of\u2010life (HRQoL) outcomes are important to consider, yet few studies have examined HRQoL among patients with PCa who were managed with AS. In this study, the authors compared longitudinal HRQoL in a prospective, racially diverse, and contemporary cohort of patients who underwent RP or AS for low\u2010risk PCa.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMETHODS<br>\nBeginning in 2007, HRQoL data from validated questionnaires (the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and the 36\u2010item RAND Medical Outcomes Study short\u2010form survey) were collected by the Center for Prostate Disease Research in a multicenter national database. Patients aged \u226475 years who were diagnosed with low\u2010risk PCa and elected RP or AS for initial disease management were followed for 3 years. Mean scores were estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline HRQoL, demographic characteristics, and clinical patient characteristics.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRESULTS<br>\nOf the patients with low\u2010risk PCa, 228 underwent RP, and 77 underwent AS.

Central review classified these as translocation morphology (56 patients), papillary (20 patients), renal medullary carcinoma (13 patients), chromophobe (4 patients), oncocytoma (1 patient), conventional clear cell (1 patient), and RCC not otherwise specified (25 patients). Lymph node (LN) involvement (N+) was found in 35 of 73 cases (47.9%) for which LNs were sampled, including 19 of 40 cases with primary tumors measuring <7 cm (47.5%). Using a size cutoff of 1 cm, imaging detection of LN involvement had a sensitivity of 57.14% (20 of 35 cases; 95% CI, 39.35%\u201073.68%) and a specificity of 94.59% (35 of 37 cases; 95% CI, 81.81%\u201099.34%). Distant metastases were present in 23 cases (19.2%). Initial surgery was radical nephrectomy in 88 patients (73.3%), nephron\u2010sparing surgery in 18 patients (15.0%), and biopsy in 14 patients (11.7%). Compared with patients undergoing radical nephrectomy, those treated with nephron\u2010sparing surgery were less likely to have LNs sampled (6 of 18 patients [33.3%] vs 65 of 88 patients [73.9%]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTranslocation RCC is the most common form of pediatric and adolescent RCC. Lymph node disease is common and observed among patients with small primary tumors. Imaging has a high specificity but relatively low sensitivity for the detection of such lymph node disease. Failure to sample LNs results in incomplete staging and potentially inadequate disease control for younger patients with RCC. Cancer 2015;121:2457\u20132464. \u00a9 2015 American Cancer Society.",

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND<br>\nLittle is known about recent trends in surveillance among the more than 1 million US colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Moreover, for stage I disease, which accounts for more than 30% of survivors, the guidelines are limited, and the use of surveillance has not been well studied. Guidelines were changed in 2005 to include recommendations for computed tomography (CT) surveillance in select patients, but the impact of these changes has not been explored.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMETHODS<br>\nA retrospective analysis of patients who were identified in the Survival, Epidemiology, and End Results\u2013Medicare database and underwent resection of stage I to III CRC between 2001 and 2009 was performed. The receipt of guideline\u2010determined sufficient surveillance, including office visits, colonoscopy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, and CT imaging, in the 3 years after resection was evaluated.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRESULTS<br>\nThe study included 23,990 colon cancer patients and 5665 rectal cancer patients. Rates of office visits and colonoscopy were high and stable over the study period. Rates of CEA surveillance increased over the study period but remained low, even for stage III disease. Rates of CT imaging increased gradually during the study period, but the 2005 guideline change had no effect. Stage II patients, including high\u2010risk patients, received surveillance at significantly lower rates than stage III patients despite similar recommendations. Conversely, up to 30% of stage I patients received nonrecommended CEA testing and CT imaging.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCONCLUSIONS<br>\nThere continues to be substantial underuse of surveillance for CRC survivors and particularly for stage II patients, who constitute almost 40% of survivors. The 2005 guideline change had a negligible impact on CT surveillance. Conversely, although guidelines are limited, many stage I patients are receiving intensive surveillance.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe main objectives of this study were to identify the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a patient\u2010reported outcome (PRO) endpoint across a wide range of cancer specialties and to evaluate the completeness of PRO reporting according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO extension.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRCTs with a PRO endpoint that had been performed across several cancer specialties and published between 2004 and 2013 were considered. Studies were evaluated on the basis of previously defined criteria, including the CONSORT PRO extension and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias of RCTs. Analyses were also conducted by the type of PRO endpoint (primary vs secondary) and by the cancer disease site.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 56,696 potentially eligible records were scrutinized, and 557 RCTs with a PRO evaluation, enrolling 254,677 patients overall, were identified. PROs were most frequently used in RCTs of breast (n = 123), lung (n = 85), and colorectal cancer (n = 66). Overall, PROs were secondary endpoints in 421 RCTs (76%). Four of 6 evaluated CONSORT PRO items were documented in less than 50% of the RCTs. The level of reporting was higher in RCTs with a PRO as a primary endpoint. The presence of a supplementary report was the only statistically significant factor associated with greater completeness of reporting for both RCTs with PROs as primary endpoints (\u03b2 = .19, P = .001) and RCTs with PROs as secondary endpoints (\u03b2 = .30, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImplementation of the CONSORT PRO extension is equally important across all cancer specialties. Its use can also contribute to revealing the robust PRO design of some studies, which might be obscured by poor outcome reporting. Cancer 2015. \u00a9 2015 American Cancer Society.",

In the current study, the authors evaluated the prevalence of hypertension and impaired renal function in long\u2010term survivors of nonsyndromic UWT who were treated without nephrotoxic chemotherapy or ionizing radiation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEligibility included age \u226415 years at the time of diagnosis of nonsyndromic UWT, treatment receipt before 2002, and maintenance of disease remission after unilateral nephrectomy without receipt of abdominal irradiation or nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Renal function was assessed by urinalysis and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients receiving antihypertensive medication or those with blood pressure readings of >140/90 mm Hg were considered to be hypertensive.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 75 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 3.2 years (range, 0.2\u201012.1 years) met eligibility criteria. The median length of follow\u2010up was 19.6 years (range, 10.0\u201032.8 years). All but 1 patient had stage I/II disease. Sixty\u2010eight patients (90.7%) patients had WT with favorable histology and 7 patients had anaplastic histology. Sixteen patients (21.3%) had an eGFR <90 mL/minute/1.73m2, 2 of whom also had proteinuria (12.5%). No patient had an eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73m2. Five patients (6.7%) had hypertension, 3 of whom were receiving antihypertensive medications. At the time of last follow\u2010up, no patient had developed end\u2010stage renal disease.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with UWT who were treated with unilateral radical nephrectomy without nephrotoxic chemotherapy or ionizing radiation appear to be at low risk of developing significant long\u2010term renal dysfunction. For this patient population, the routine use of partial nephrectomy does not appear justified. However, monitoring and counseling are important for identifying the rare patient who develops subtle renal insufficiency and therefore might be at an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular sequelae.

Responses to chemotherapy were similar for patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon20ins and patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR exon19del/L858R. Median OS from the diagnosis of stage IV disease for patients with EGFR exon20ins and patients with EGFR exon19del/L858R was 26 months (95% confidence interval, 19 months\u2010not reached n\u2009=\u200946) and 31 months (95% confidence interval, 28\u201033 months; n\u2009=\u2009258), respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.53).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe majority of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR exon20ins do not respond to EGFR TKI therapy. Standard chemotherapy should be used as first\u2010line therapy. These patients have an OS similar to that of patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Individuals with certain variants such as FQEA and ASV may respond to erlotinib. Cancer 2015. \u00a9 2015 American Cancer Society.",

There was no significant difference in response noted among the 3 regimens: 55% overall (P = .18). For the intent\u2010to\u2010transplant population, a similar percentage were successfully bridged to transplant without further therapy (62%; P = .9). There was no difference in survival observed across the 3 regimens, with an overall median progression\u2010free survival of 4.5 months (95% confidence interval, 3.6\u20105.5 months [P = .8]) and a median overall survival of 8.5 months (95% confidence interval, 6.1\u201011 months [P = .8]). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference noted among clinically relevant adverse events, although there was a suggestion of fewer adverse events with DCEP. Patients treated with the intent to transplant had superior outcomes for response (odds ratio, 3.40; P = .01), progression\u2010free survival (hazard ratio, 0.28; P<.001), and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.19; P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 3 salvage regimens demonstrated similar responses, survival, and adverse events. Given the short response durations observed in the recurrent/refractory disease setting, infusional chemotherapy is best suited for cytoreduction before more definitive therapy is administered.

Patients with secondary APL who were included in that trial also were compared with a previous retrospective cohort of patients with secondary APL.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the APL\u20102006 trial, 42 of 280 patients (15%) had secondary APL. Compared with the retrospective cohort, patients with secondary APL in the APL\u20102006 trial had a lower incidence of prior breast carcinoma (35.7% vs 57%; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and a higher incidence of prior prostate carcinoma (26.2% vs 4.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

Although population studies have identified factors associated with its use, to the best of the authors knowledge, assessment of why patients use CAM or the barriers against its use have not been examined to date.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors conducted a cross\u2010sectional survey study in the thoracic, breast, and gastrointestinal medical oncology clinics at an academic cancer center. Clinical and demographic variables were collected by self\u2010report and chart abstraction. Attitudes and beliefs were measured using the validated Attitudes and Beliefs about CAM (ABCAM) instrument. This instrument divides attitudes and beliefs into 3 domains: expected benefits, perceived barriers, and subjective norms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 969 participants (response rate, 82.7%) surveyed between June 2010 and September 2011, patient age \u226465 years, female sex, and college education were associated with a significantly greater expected benefit from CAM (P<.0001 for all). Nonwhite patients reported more perceived barriers to CAM use compared with white patients (P<.0001), but had a similar degree of expected benefit (P\u2009=\u2009.76). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, all domains of the ABCAM instrument were found to be significantly associated with CAM use (P<.01 for all) among patients with cancer. Attitudes and beliefs regarding CAM explained much more variance in CAM use than clinical and demographic variables alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAttitudes and beliefs varied by key clinical and demographic characteristics, and predicted CAM use. By developing CAM programs based upon attitudes and beliefs, barriers among underserved patient populations may be removed and more patient centered care may be provided.

Several lines of evidence, including the graft versus leukemia effect associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), suggest that immunotherapy is an active modality in AML. Given the lack of progress for chemotherapy in this disease, many novel immunologic treatment approaches have been explored. The goals of non\u2010transplant\u2010based immune approaches have largely consisted of the stimulation or restoration of endogenous immune responses or the targeting of specific tumor antigens by immune cells. These strategies have been associated with less toxicity than allogeneic HSCT but typically have inferior efficacy.

Overall survival (OS) was compared using the log\u2010rank test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlack patients were on average younger than white patients (median age, 42 years vs 45 years; P =.0001), more often female (49% vs 29%; P<.0001), and more likely to have the axillary lymph nodes as the primary disease site (25% vs 17%; P =.0002).

In this study, the authors tested the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention for FCGs of patients diagnosed with stage I through IV nonsmall cell lung cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFCGs who were identified by patients as their primary caregivers were enrolled in a prospective, quasi\u2010experimental study in which the usual care group was accrued first followed by the intervention group. FCGs in the intervention group were presented at interdisciplinary care meetings, and they also received 4 educational sessions organized in the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains. The sessions included self\u2010care plans to support the FCG's own needs. Caregiver burden, caregiving skills preparedness, psychological distress, and FCG quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks using validated measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 366 FCGs were included in the primary analysis. FCGs who received the interdisciplinary palliative care intervention had significantly better scores for social well being (5.84 vs 6.86; P < .001) and had lower psychological distress scores (4.61 vs 4.20; P = .010) at 12 weeks compared with FCGs in the usual care group. FCGs in the intervention group also had significantly less caregiver burden compared with FCGs in the usual care group (P = .008).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn interdisciplinary approach to palliative care in lung cancer resulted in statistically significant improvements in FCG's social well being and psychological distress and in less caregiver burden.

An option for gaining similar benefits with less toxicity would be the administration of irinotecan through a hepatic artery approach. The aim of this study was to assess the response and adverse event rates for irinotecan drug\u2010eluting beads (DEBIRI) with folinic acid, 5\u2010fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab as a first\u2010line treatment for unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMETHODS<br>\nPatients with colorectal liver metastases were randomly assigned to modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) and bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab, and DEBIRI (FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI). The primary endpoint was the response rate. The secondary endpoints were adverse events, the rate of conversion to resection, and progression\u2010free survival.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRESULTS<br>\nThe intention\u2010to\u2010treat population comprised 70 patients: 10 patients in the pilot and then 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI arm and 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm. The 2 groups were similar with respect to the extent of liver involvement (30% vs 30%), but a greater percentage of patients in the FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI arm had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or 2 (57% vs 31%) and extrahepatic disease (56% vs 32%, P\u2009=\u2009.02). The median numbers of chemotherapy cycles were similar (10 vs 9), and there were similar rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (54% for the FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI group vs 46% for the FOLFOX/bevacizumab group). The overall response rate was significantly greater in the FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm at 2 (78% vs 54%, P\u2009=\u2009.02), 4 (95% vs 70%, P\u2009=\u2009.03), and 6 months (76% vs 60%, P\u2009=\u2009.05). There was significantly more downsizing to resection in the FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm (35% vs 16%, P\u2009=\u2009.05), and there was improved median progression\u2010free survival (15.3 vs 7.6 months).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nCONCLUSIONS<br>\nThe simultaneous administration of mFOLFOX6 (with or without bevacizumab) and DEBIRI through the hepatic artery (FOLFOX\u2010DEBIRI) is safe and does not cause treatment delays or increase the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy.

It is unknown whether comorbidity interacts clinically with prostate cancer (PC) to increase the VTE rate beyond that explained by PC and comorbidity alone, for example, by delaying diagnosis or precluding treatment.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMETHODS<br>\nA nationwide, registry\u2010based cohort study of all 44,035 Danish patients diagnosed with PC from 1995 to 2011 and 213,810 men from the general population matched 5:1 on age, calendar time, and comorbidities. The authors calculated VTE rate ratios and the interaction contrast as a measure on the additive scale of the excess VTE rate explained by synergy between PC and comorbidity.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nRESULTS<br>\nIn total, 849 patients in the PC cohort and 2360 men from the general population had VTE during 5 years of follow\u2010up, and their risk of VTE was 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents one of the most common risk factors for HCC development, and cases of HCV\u2010related complications have been rising over the last 2 decades. Although the standard for HCV therapy has been interferon (IFN)\u2010based for many years, the therapeutic revolution spurred by the development of direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAAs) promises to usher in a new era in which chronic HCV becomes a rare disease. On the basis of long\u2010term follow\u2010up of patients experiencing IFN\u2010based sustained virological responses (SVRs), it can be expected that rates of HCV\u2010associated HCC will decrease significantly after the widespread adoption of DAAs, but there remains a persistent risk for HCC even among some patients with advanced fibrosis who have achieved SVR. As such, individuals treated for HCV with advanced fibrosis should continue to be screened regularly for HCC after SVR. Furthermore, as the population of SVR patients grows, it will become imperative to accurately identify those individuals at high risk for developing HCC, appropriately allocate resources for screening, and consider cost\u2010effective chemopreventive strategies. Risk factors include preexisting advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, older age, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol use. In addition, laboratory biomarkers and genetic signatures are currently being identified that not only predict the likelihood of HCC development in SVR patients but also may serve as dynamic indicators of therapeutic response.

Changes to screening utilization will affect observed reductions in CIN2+ rates and complicate the interpretation of vaccine impact.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom 2008 to 2012, 9119 cases of CIN2+ among 18\u2010 to 39\u2010year\u2010old residents of catchment areas in California, Connecticut, New York, and Oregon were reported to the HPV\u2010IMPACT Project, a sentinel system for monitoring the population impact of HPV vaccine. Age\u2010stratified CIN2+ incidence rates were calculated for each catchment. Annual cervical screening was estimated for California, New York, and Oregon catchments with administrative and survey data. The Cochran\u2010Armitage test was used to examine trends.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom 2008 to 2012, the incidence of CIN2+ significantly decreased among 18\u2010 to 20\u2010year\u2010olds (California, from 94 to 5 per 100,000 women; Connecticut, from 450 to 57 per 100,000 women; New York, from 299 to 43 per 100,000 women; and Oregon, from 202 to 37 per 100,000 women; Ptrend\u2009<\u2009.0001) and among 21\u2010 to 29\u2010year\u2010olds in Connecticut (from 762 to 589 per 100,000 women) and New York (from 770 to 465 per 100,000 women; Ptrend\u2009<\u2009.001); rates did not differ among 30\u2010 to 39\u2010year\u2010olds. During the same period, screening rates also declined, with the largest decreases among 18\u2010 to 20\u2010year\u2010olds (from 67% in Oregon to 88% in California) and with smaller declines among 21\u2010 to 29\u2010year\u2010olds (13%\u201027%) and 30\u2010 to 39\u2010year\u2010olds (3%\u201021%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe declines in CIN2+ detection in young women were likely due to reduced screening but could also reflect the impact of vaccination.

This commentary examines the value of the treatment of hematologic malignancies at current prices in the United States through a reanalysis of a systematic review evaluating 29 studies of 9 treatments for 4 hematologic malignancies. Incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated on the basis of drug prices in the United States in 2014. Sixty\u2010three percent of the studies (15 of 24) had ICERs higher than $50,000 per quality\u2010adjusted life\u2010year (QALY), the benchmark widely used by health economists to define cost\u2010effectiveness. In studies evaluating the current standard\u2010of\u2010care treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia, the ICERs for tyrosine kinase inhibitors versus hydroxyurea or interferon ranged from $210,000 to $426,000/QALY. The lower ICER values were mostly obtained from 11 studies evaluating rituximab, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 (ICER range, $37,000\u2010$69,000/QALY).

The primary endpoint was progression\u2010free survival (PFS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe trial met its primary endpoint and was closed to accrual subsequent to interim analysis. Forty\u2010eight patients in the TX group (46.2%) and 42 patients in the NX group (41.2%) received maintenance medication.

Patients aged \u226540 years who were postmenopausal and presented with visceral metastases were more likely to benefit from the TX regimen in terms of PFS and OS, whereas positive hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status or a history of taxane treatments did not affect differences in PFS and OS between the TX and NX groups. Hand\u2010foot syndrome occurred more frequently in the TX group than in the NX group (47% vs 16.7%; P < .0001), but the frequencies of other minor adverse effects were similar in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA TX regimen for advanced breast cancer followed by capecitabine maintenance medication led to longer PFS and response duration than an NX regimen, even for patients who had previously received taxane in (neo)adjuvant settings.

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nElderly patients with early\u2010stage breast cancer (ESBC) derive a local control benefit from radiotherapy (RT) after lumpectomy, without any apparent effect on overall survival. Therefore, the use of RT is controversial. In the current study, the authors characterized updated trends in RT for elderly patients with estrogen receptor (ER)\u2010positive ESBC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients aged \u226570 years with ER\u2010positive ESBC measuring \u22642 cm after lumpectomy with negative resection margins and known RT details were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were classified by year of diagnosis and segregated into 3 groups relative to the initial publication and updated presentation of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial. RT use overall, prescription of hypofractionated RT, and use of boost RT were compared between groups using logistic regression analysis, and the influence of clinicopathologic covariates was determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 122,796 elderly patients with ER\u2010positive ESBC who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2011 were identified. Overall, 84,649 patients (68.9%) received adjuvant RT, with a decline observed between successive cohorts (71.3% in the pre\u2010initial publication cohort, 69.5% in the pre\u2010update cohort, and 64.7% in the post\u2010update cohort; P <.001). Hypofractionated RT use increased among treated patients over time (P<.001). Boost RT was used in 67.5% of patients, with a decline noted between the pre\u2010update and post\u2010update cohorts (68.7% vs 57.7%; P<.001). Overall RT use as well as use of boost RT were found to be lower among older patients and those with lower\u2010grade or smaller tumors (P<.001), whereas hypofractionated RT was used more commonly in these groups (P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRT use appears to have declined in elderly patients with ER\u2010positive ESBC, a finding that is reflective of evidence\u2010based practice integrating mature trial data. Further research is needed to develop tools to aid in the decision\u2010making process regarding the delivery or avoidance of RT in this setting.

The number of survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is growing rapidly and HCT clinicians are aware that many of their patients use CAM therapies consistently. However, due to a paucity of data regarding the benefits and harms of CAM therapies in these survivors, clinicians are reluctant to provide specific recommendations for or against particular CAM therapies. A systematic literature review was conducted with a search using PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid online for each CAM therapy as defined by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The search generated 462 references, of which 26 articles were deemed to be relevant for the review. Due to extensive heterogeneity in data and limited randomized trials, a meta\u2010analysis could not be performed but a comprehensive systematic review was conducted with specified outcomes for each CAM therapy. In randomized controlled trials, certain mind and body interventions such as relaxation were observed to be effective in alleviating psychological symptoms in patients undergoing HCT, whereas the majority of the other CAM treatments were found to have mixed results. CAM use is an understudied area in HCT survivorship and clinicians should convey the benefits and uncertainties concerning the role of CAM therapies to their patients.

                "abstract": "Neighborhood social and built environments have been recognized as important contexts in which health is shaped. The authors reviewed the extent to which these neighborhood factors have been addressed in population\u2010level cancer research by scanning the literature for research focused on specific social and/or built environment characteristics and their association with outcomes across the cancer continuum, including incidence, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and survival. The commonalities and differences in methodologies across studies, the current challenges in research methodology, and future directions in this research also were addressed. The assessment of social and built environment factors in relation to cancer is a relatively new field, with 82% of the 34 reviewed articles published since 2010. Across the wide range of social and built environment exposures and cancer outcomes considered by the studies, numerous associations were reported. However, the directions and magnitudes of associations varied, in large part because of the variation in cancer sites and outcomes studied, but also likely because of differences in study populations, geographic regions, and, importantly, choice of neighborhood measures and geographic scales. The authors recommend that future studies consider the life\u2010course implications of cancer incidence and survival, integrate secondary and self\u2010report data, consider work neighborhood environments, and further develop analytical and statistical approaches appropriate to the geospatial and multilevel nature of the data. Incorporating social and built environment factors into research on cancer etiology and outcomes can provide insights into disease processes, identify vulnerable populations, and generate results with translational impact of relevance for interventionists and policy makers.

The purpose of this study was to examine the disparities in overall survival (OS) by insurance status in a large cohort of patients with HL.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was used to evaluate patients with stage I to IV HL from 1998 to 2011. The association between insurance status, covariables, and outcomes was assessed in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan\u2010Meier method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 76,681 patients within the NCDB, 45,777 patients with stage I to IV HL were eligible for this study (median follow\u2010up, 6.0 years). The median age was 39 years (range, 18\u201090 years). The insurance status was as follows: 3247 (7.1%) were uninsured, 7962 (17.4%) had Medicaid, 30,334 (66.3%) had private insurance, 3746 (8.2%) had managed care, and 488 (1.1%) had Medicare. Patients with an unfavorable insurance status (Medicaid/uninsured) were at a more advanced stage, had higher comorbidity scores, had B symptoms, and were in a lower income/education quartile (all P\u2009<\u2009.01). These patients were less likely to receive radiotherapy and start chemotherapy promptly and were less commonly treated at academic/research centers (all P\u2009<\u2009.01). Patients with unfavorable insurance had a 5\u2010year OS of 54% versus 87% for those favorably insured (P\u2009<\u2009.01).

AYA cancer survivors indicate reproductive health is an issue of great importance and more attention is needed in the health care setting throughout the cancer experience, beginning at diagnosis. Various practice guidelines are predominately focused on fertility; are intended to influence survivorship care plans; and do not encompass the broad scope of reproductive health that includes romantic partnering, friendships, body image, sexuality, sexual identity, fertility, contraception, and more. Although interventions to reduce reproductive health\u2010related sequelae from treatment are best approached as an evolving process, practitioners are not certain of the priorities of these various reproductive health content areas. Strategies incongruent with the reproductive health priorities of AYAs will likely thwart adequate follow\u2010up care and foster feelings of isolation from the treatment team.

The authors engaged the National Cancer Data Base to analyze patterns of care and survival outcomes for patients with early\u2010stage follicular lymphoma in the era of modern therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA National Cancer Data Base retrospective cohort study was conducted of 35,961 patients with lymph node and extranodal, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to II, WHO grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2012. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify sociodemographic, treatment, and tumor characteristics that were predictive of overall survival (OS) and treatment use. Propensity score\u2010adjusted Cox proportional hazards ratios for survival in patients treated for follicular lymphoma were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 35,961 patients with follicular lymphoma included in the current study, 63% had stage I disease, 79% were without extranodal disease, and 61% were aged >60 years. RT use decreased from 37% in 1999 to 24% in 2012 (P<.0001), with corresponding significant increases in observation and single\u2010agent chemotherapy. Patients who received RT had 5\u2010year and 10\u2010year OS rates of 86% and 68%, respectively, compared with 74% and 54%, respectively, for those who did not receive RT (P<.0001). On multivariable survival analysis, including a propensity score to account for potential uncaptured confounding variables due to a lack of randomization, upfront RT remained independently associated with improved OS (hazard ratio of death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.47\u20100.63 [P<.0001]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRT is an increasingly underused treatment approach in the era of modern therapy for patients with early\u2010stage follicular lymphoma.

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) have been designed to overcome this resistance and, to date, have begun to show clinical efficacy. However, clinical HAPs activity could be improved. In this study, we sought to identify non-pharmacological methods to acutely exacerbate tumor hypoxia to increase TH-302 activity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor models.<br>\nResults:<br>\nThree human PDAC cell lines with varying sensitivity to TH-302 (Hs766t >\u2009MiaPaCa-2\u2009>\u2009SU.86.86) were used to establish PDAC xenograft models. PDAC cells were metabolically profiled in vitro and in vivo using the Seahorse XF system and hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI, respectively, in addition to quantitative immunohistochemistry. The effect of exogenous pyruvate on tumor oxygenation was determined using electroparamagnetic resonance (EPR) oxygen imaging. Hs766t and MiaPaCa-2 cells exhibited a glycolytic phenotype in comparison to TH-302 resistant line SU.86.86. Supporting this observation is a higher lactate/pyruvate ratio in Hs766t and MiaPaCa xenografts as observed during hyperpolarized pyruvate MRI studies in vivo. Coincidentally, response to exogenous pyruvate both in vitro (Seahorse oxygen consumption) and in vivo (EPR oxygen imaging) was greatest in Hs766t and MiaPaCa models, possibly due to a higher mitochondrial reserve capacity. Changes in oxygen consumption and in vivo hypoxic status to pyruvate were limited in the SU.86.86 model. Combination therapy of pyruvate plus TH-302 in vivo significantly decreased tumor growth and increased survival in the MiaPaCa model and improved survival in Hs766t tumors.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nUsing metabolic profiling, functional imaging, and computational modeling, we show improved TH-302 activity by transiently increasing tumor hypoxia metabolically with exogenous pyruvate.

An ERKD protocol was used in this pilot clinical study. In addition to the two patients who enrolled in this study, we also reviewed findings from 30 other patients, including 5 patients from case reports, 19 patients from a clinical trial reported by Rieger and 6 patients described by Champ.

SDH mutations resulting in enzymatic dysfunction have been found to be a predisposing factor in various hereditary cancers. Therefore, SDH has been implicated as a tumor suppressor.<br>\nResults:<br>\nWe identified that dysregulation of SDH components also occurs in serous ovarian cancer, particularly the SDH subunit SDHB. Targeted knockdown of Sdhb in mouse ovarian cancer cells resulted in enhanced proliferation and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that decreased SDHB expression leads to a transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in metabolic networks affecting histone methylation. We confirmed that Sdhb knockdown leads to a hypermethylated epigenome that is sufficient to promote EMT. Metabolically, the loss of Sdhb resulted in reprogrammed carbon source utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction. This altered metabolic state of Sdhb knockdown cells rendered them hypersensitive to energy stress.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nThese data illustrate how SDH dysfunction alters the epigenetic and metabolic landscape in ovarian cancer. By analyzing the involvement of this enzyme in transcriptional and metabolic networks, we find a metabolic Achilles\u2019 heel that can be exploited therapeutically.

Mitophagy can have the beneficial effect of eliminating old and/or damaged mitochondria, thus maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial pool. However, mitophagy is not only limited to the turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria but also promotes reduction of overall mitochondrial mass in response to certain stresses, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation. This prevents generation of reactive oxygen species and conserves valuable nutrients (such as oxygen) from being consumed inefficiently, thereby promoting cellular survival under conditions of energetic stress. The failure to properly modulate mitochondrial turnover in response to oncogenic stresses has been implicated both positively and negatively in tumorigenesis, while the potential of targeting mitophagy specifically as opposed to autophagy in general as a therapeutic strategy remains to be explored. The challenges and opportunities that come with our heightened understanding of the role of mitophagy in cancer are reviewed here.",

In nutrient and oxygen replete conditions, acetyl-CoA is predominantly derived from glucose. In hypoxia, however, flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA decreases, and the fractional contribution of glutamine to acetyl-CoA increases. The significance of other acetyl-CoA sources, however, has not been rigorously evaluated. Here we investigate quantitatively, using 13C-tracers and mass spectrometry, the sources of acetyl-CoA in hypoxia.<br>\nResults:<br>\nIn normoxic conditions, cultured cells produced more than 90% of acetyl-CoA from glucose and glutamine-derived carbon. In hypoxic cells, this contribution dropped, ranging across cell lines from 50% to 80%. Thus, under hypoxia, one or more additional substrates significantly contribute to acetyl-CoA production. 13C-tracer experiments revealed that neither amino acids nor fatty acids are the primary source of this acetyl-CoA.

Cells with PHGDH amplification are dependent on enzyme expression for proliferation. However, dependence on increased PHGDH expression extends beyond production of serine alone, and further studies of PHGDH function are necessary to elucidate its role in cancer cells. These studies will require a physiologically relevant form of the enzyme for experiments using engineered cell lines and recombinant protein.<br>\nResults:<br>\nThe addition of an N-terminal epitope tag to PHGDH abolished the ability to support proliferation of PHGDH-amplified cells despite retention of some activity to convert 3-PG to PHP. Introducing an R236E mutation into PHGDH eliminates enzyme activity, and this catalytically inactive enzyme cannot support proliferation of PHGDH-dependent cells, arguing that canonical enzyme activity is required. Tagged and untagged PHGDH exhibit the same intracellular localization and ability to produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an error product of PHGDH, arguing that neither mislocalization nor loss of D-2HG production explains the inability of epitope-tagged PHGDH to support proliferation. To enable studies of PHGDH function, we report a method to purify recombinant PHGDH and found that untagged enzyme activity was greater than N-terminally tagged enzyme. Analysis of tagged and untagged PHGDH using size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy found that an N-terminal epitope tag alters enzyme structure.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nPurification of untagged recombinant PHGDH eliminates the need to use an epitope tag for enzyme studies.

Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) can be used to infer steady state fluxes, but it does not apply for transient dynamics. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) can be used in the context of transient dynamics, and it is the current gold standard. However, KFP requires measurements at several time points, limiting its use in high-throughput applications.<br>\nResults:<br>\nHere we propose transient MFA (tMFA) as a cost-effective methodology to quantify metabolic fluxes using metabolomics and isotope tracing. tMFA exploits the time scale separation between the dynamics of different metabolites to obtain mathematical equations relating metabolic fluxes to metabolite concentrations and isotope fractions. We show that the isotope fractions of serine and glycine are at steady state 8 h after addition of a tracer, while those of purines and glutathione are following a transient dynamics with an approximately constant turnover rate per unit of metabolite, supporting the application of tMFA to the analysis of folate metabolism. Using tMFA, we investigate the heterogeneity of folate metabolism and the response to the antifolate methotrexate in breast cancer cells. Our analysis indicates that methotrexate not only inhibits purine synthesis but also induces an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, activation of AMP kinase (AMPK), and the inhibition of protein and glutathione synthesis. We also find that in some cancer cells, the generation of one-carbon units from serine exceeds the biosynthetic demand.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nThis work validates tMFA as a cost-effective methodology to investigate cell metabolism.

Rapidly proliferating tissues, including human tumors, use PDH to generate energy and macromolecular precursors. However, evidence supports the benefits of constraining maximal PDH activity under certain contexts, including hypoxia and oncogene-induced cell growth. Although PDH is one of the most widely studied enzyme complexes in mammals, its requirement for cell growth is unknown. In this study, we directly addressed whether PDH is required for mammalian cells to proliferate.<br>\nResults:<br>\nWe genetically suppressed expression of the PDHA1 gene encoding an essential subunit of the PDH complex and characterized the effects on intermediary metabolism and cell proliferation using a combination of stable isotope tracing and growth assays. Surprisingly, rapidly dividing cells tolerated loss of PDH activity without major effects on proliferative rates in complete medium. PDH suppression increased reliance on extracellular lipids, and in some cell lines, reducing lipid availability uncovered a modest growth defect that could be completely reversed by providing exogenous-free fatty acids. PDH suppression also shifted the source of lipogenic acetyl-CoA from glucose to glutamine, and this compensatory pathway required a net reductive isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) flux to produce a source of glutamine-derived acetyl-CoA for fatty acids. By deleting the cytosolic isoform of IDH (IDH1), the enhanced contribution of glutamine to the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool during PDHA1 suppression was eliminated, and growth was modestly suppressed.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nAlthough PDH suppression substantially alters central carbon metabolism, the data indicate that rapid cell proliferation occurs independently of PDH activity. Our findings reveal that this central enzyme is essentially dispensable for growth and proliferation of both primary cells and established cell lines. We also identify the compensatory mechanisms that are activated under PDH deficiency, namely scavenging of extracellular lipids and lipogenic acetyl-CoA production from reductive glutamine metabolism through IDH1.",

Development of nanomedicines as drug carriers (nanocarriers) that target cancer for therapy draws upon principles in the fields of chemistry, medicine, physics, biology, and engineering. Given the zealous activity in the field as demonstrated by more than 30 nanocarriers already approved for clinical use and given the promise of recent clinical results in various studies, nanocarrier-based strategies are anticipated to soon have a profound impact on cancer medicine and human health. Herein, we will detail the latest innovations in therapeutic nanomedicine with examples from lipid-based nanoparticles and polymer-based approaches, which are engineered to deliver anticancer drugs to metastatic lung cells.

The initiation and progression of lung cancer is the result of the interaction between permanent genetic and dynamic epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation is the best studied epigenetic mark in human cancers. Altered DNA methylation in cancer was identified in 1983. Within 30\u00a0years of this discovery, DNA methylation inhibitors are used clinically to treat a variety of cancers, highlighting the importance of the epigenetic basis of cancer. In addition, histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling, and micro RNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation are also fundamental to tumor genesis. Distinct chromatin alterations occur in all stages of lung cancer, including initiation, growth, and metastasis. Therefore, stage-specific epigenetic changes can be used as powerful and reliable tools for early diagnosis of lung cancer and to monitor patient prognosis. Moreover, since epigenetic changes are dynamic and reversible, chromatin modifiers are promising targets for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against cancer. This review summarizes the chromatin alterations in lung cancer, focusing on the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetic modifications that could help to reduce the high case-fatality rate of this dreadful disease.</p>",

The present paper describes a novel approach to detect potential disease genes for lung cancer, based on consistently differential interaction (CDI) scheme from heterogeneous disease datasets. In particular, reliable disordered regulations in disease states were discovered by identifying the CDIs, from which the disease genes were further detected based on their topological structures on the network. As an application of the CDI-based method, the RNA-seq data of two subtypes of non-small lung cancer were used to identify CDIs from normal to cancer onset. The results of analysis well agree with the prior knowledge as well as the experiments, thereby implying the predictive power of the CDI-based method. The comparison with other approaches also indicated the superiority of the CDI-based method in terms of accuracy and effectiveness on detecting disease-specific genes for lung cancer and metastasis. In contrast to conventional molecular biomarkers, the identified CDIs as novel network biomarkers or edge biomarkers can be applied to predict patient survival for both subtypes of lung cancers, and the interactions among CDIs can be further used as new edgetic targets for network drug design. In addition, a potential molecular mechanism was developed to explain the key roles of the identified CDIs in lung cancer and metastasis from a network perspective.</p>",

Early results have reported favorable survival for some, with improved median survival, and approximately 25\u00a0% alive long term. Patients with fewer metastases, those treated to all known cancerous sites, and longer disease-free intervals tend to have better outcomes. While promising, better clinical criteria are needed to optimize patient selection.

Many important genes responsible for the genesis of various cancers have been discovered, their mutations precisely identified and the pathways through which they act characterized. One question that remains unanswered is whether the development of new, more specific therapeutic agents is the best way to minimize cancer morbidity and mortality in the long-term. Metastasis is the relentless pursuit of cancer to escape its primary site and colonize distant organs. Phenotypic changes during cancer progression reflect the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations, which endow cancer cells with the ability to undergo their own divergent evolution and create distinct metastatic species. In order to understand this process, it is crucial to identify genes whose alterations accumulate during cancer progression and correlate with metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells.</p>",

About 60, 214, 26, or 49 up-regulated type-special genes, and 67, 35, 114, or 141 down-regulated type-special genes were identified in adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), large cell carcinoma (LCC) or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively. About 5, 2, 8, or 1 stage-specific genes were up-regulated, while 23, 8, 2, or 90 stage-specific genes were down-regulated in ADC at stage I, II, III, or IV, respectively. Two stage-specific genes were significantly up-regulated in SCC at stage II, while 2 or 18 stage-specific genes in SCC at stage I or III were down-regulated, respectively. Lung cancer prognostic prediction rates of subtype- or stage-specific genes were further evaluated.

Thus, the administered dose errors could be determined and consequently preserving patients' rights to evaluate the cancer treatment through the provided mathematical model. Reasons of tumor regrowth are either underestimation or overestimation of the administered dose; the safe dose of the successful treatment occurs only in the case of: E0Dose = E0Tumor, where tumor regrowth energy in such a case would be vanished.

An accurate localization of the tumor is, however, essential to guide the surgeon to the lesion, and ensure its correct and adequate removal with satisfactory excision margins. Current breast tumor localization techniques are invasive and often result in a cosmetic disfigurement. In this paper, we use the ultrawide band radar-based microwave breast imaging technique to non-invasively localize (impalpable) tumors in the breast. We consider four clinically important lesion features: location, size, depth and spatial orientation within the breast. A comparison of the energy of the received signal from healthy and cancerous breasts exhibits some remarkable differences in some frequency bands. We, therefore, use the energy spectrum of the receiving antenna signal decomposed by wavelet transform as the input to a Simultaneous Perturbation Neural Network (SPNN) classifier. Furthermore, we determine the optimum structure and gains of the SPNN, in terms of optimum initial weights and optimum number of nodes in the hidden layer. We use CST Microwave Studio to simulate a data set of 1024 cancer cases with various tumor location, size, depth and direction inside the breast. Our results show that the proposed algorithm gives accurate localization of the breast lesion, and possesses a high sensitivity to small tumor sizes.

Blood samples were collected from 25 patients with HCC, 32 patients with chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis and chronic HBV/HCV), and 30 healthy individuals as control. AFP-L3 and Total Alpha Fetoprotein (T.AFP) were measured by immunometric assay. AFP-L3 and T.AFP were elevated in all patients (chronic liver disease and HCC patients). Both markers were found to be elevated with the increase of tumor size, and with presence of focal liver lesion (being elevating with the increase of number of lesions).Both markers showed to be elevated until a year after onset of the disease, then, decreased by time. AFP-L3 and T.AFP were positively correlated with the increase of patient's age, but no significant difference was found between males and females in all types of patients. AFP-L3 is more specific for HCC, this encourage us to use AFP-L3 as adjunct marker for HCC diagnosis.",

Various sexual behaviors, heavy tobacco and alcohol use, HPV infection, and lack of HPV vaccination may increase the risk of head and neck cancer in the younger male population. The study was conducted to identify the risk factors for head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC) among college students. A convenience sample of 1,685 students from an undergraduate health course was selected for the study. The self-reported, anonymous electronic questionnaire included items on the following risk factors: tobacco and alcohol use, HPV infection and/or presence of genital warts, oral hygiene, open-mouth kissing, and practice of various sexual behaviors. Statistical results showed that among college-aged males, the use of tobacco products and alcohol is much higher than females (P=0.000). Significance was also found between gender and sexual behaviors in one\u2019s lifetime and within the past 12 months (P=0.000). On average, males have higher numbers of vaginal and oral sex partners than females. In addition, males reported having twice the number of open-mouth kissing partners compared to their female counterparts (6 as opposed to 3). Importantly, the percentage of males who completed all three HPV vaccinations in the series is much lower (10.1%) than females (89.9%) which make them more vulnerable to HPV transmission, thus increasing the risk of HNSCC. College-aged males seem to be engaged in more high-risk activities related to HNSCC compared to their female counterparts. Integration of preventive public health strategies should be considered.",

However, efficiency of radiotherapy is limited by radiosensitivity of intact tissues surrounding the tumor on the one hand, and by radioresistance of the malignancy on the other hand. The problem of overcoming radiation resistance of tumors is a key element in the local control of tumor growth [1]. Introduction of radiosensitizers into a tumor with subsequent irradiation results in secondary radiation inside the tumor, thus increasing the effect of radiotherapy. Various substances capable of converting ionizing radiation can serve as radiosensitizers. This may be diagnostic preparations containing heavy chemical elements, such as iodine, gadolinium, gold nanoparticles, platinum and other chemicals [5]. The aim of our experiment was selection of a drug which would give a significant increase of the secondary radiation in biological tissues when irradiating with gamma rays (GR) with the energy of 1.25 MeV. We used as a radiation sensitizer a drug containing gold nanoparticles and iodine particles which, when introduced directly into a tumor, will increase energy of the radiation inside the tumor without increasing the dose permitted according to the plan of exposure.",

Animal models played an important role in establishing causation and mechanism of bacteria-induced MALT lymphoma. In this review we discuss different ways that animal models have been applied to establish a link between the gut microbiota and lymphoma and how animal models have helped to elucidate mechanisms of microbiota-induced lymphoma.

Schiestl&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\nRadiation is a widely known, and prototypical, inducer of genotoxic damage. With every moment of exposure to ionizing radiation, lesions and breaks are induced in the DNA, increasing an individual\u2019s lifetime risk of developing cancer. At the same time, radiation therapy is a key part of the effective treatment of the very same disease. Radiation therapy is effective, capable of shrinking and even eliminating tumors. In conjunction with surgery, its use is extremely common for the treatment of breast cancer. Even when radiation is our ally, however, the risks remain. Therapeutic use to treat existing cancers paradoxically leads to the incidence of secondary, radiation-induced neoplasias. One strategy to reduce this secondary risk while still encouraging the use of radiotherapy to its full potential would be the development co-administered therapeutic compounds or strategies designed to preferentially protect healthy cells while leaving cancer cells vulnerable. The development and efficacy testing such agents would require not only extensive in vitro testing, but also a well investigated set of in vivo models to actively recapitulate the complex nature of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The laboratory mouse Mus musculus is probably the best choice for this endeavor. As a cancer model it possesses a combination of favorable attributes: a well annotated genome, molecular and physiological similarities with man and other mammals, and a small size and high breeding rate for ease of use. This work will focus on the description of m. musculus inbred and F1 hybrid animal models of radiation-induced breast cancers and their associated molecular pathologies.",

Methods: Forty-seven patients with breast cancer (stage T2-4, any N), underwent surgery and received adjuvant systemic treatment and radiotherapy. These patients randomly divided into two groups; conventional fractionated radiotherapy group (N: 22), and hypofractionated radiotherapy group (N: 25). Data of radiation toxicities, and disease relapse in both groups were compared using Chi-square test. Results: The median follow-up was 34 months (range: 13 \u2013 53 months).

However, imiquimod-based TCI, we have previously developed, shows only limited effectiveness in terms of tumor protection, partly due to suppression by regulatory T (Treg) cells. To improve the vaccination potency we combined TCI with the cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide (Cy) that is used for the treatment of tumors and described to mediate inactivation of Treg cells at low doses. Cy only slightly reduced Treg cell numbers in a concentration dependent manner under the chosen conditions, but also enhanced DC activation. Therefore, we used Cy-TCI in a therapeutic tumor assay where E.G7 lymphomas were subcutaneously transplanted and allowed to grow until palpable before the treatments started. Interestingly, the rates of tumor protection in TCI or Cy-TCI treated groups were identical. Towards the underlying mechanisms of the failure of Cy-TCI to provide enhanced tumor protection, we observed increased numbers of monocytic and granulocytic immature myeloid cells after Cy-TCI, partly suppressing TCI-induced immune responses. Taken together, we suggest that Cy-TCI induces inhibitory mechanisms counterregulating TCI enhancing effects, therefore suppressing vaccination-induced immune responses.",

This challenges some tenets of the conventional paradigm of life sciences based on DNA, restoring a role of the environment in biological processes like the regulation of development, cell differentiation and disease. The environment \u2014 in a broad sense \u2014 affects biological phenotypes throughout the entire lifespan and can induce cancer, its progression and recurrence as well as its reversal. This is very important in cancer epidemiology as it implies that environmental exposures can be considered both as risk (or protective) and prognostic factors. This review integrates information from epidemiologic and biological research. We studied the impact of hazardous and protective exposures, lifestyles, and diet on the survival of patients who had been diagnosed with cancer. We selected studies from two digital databases, using a few combinations of key terms, namely overall survival, cancer-specific survival, recurrence and quality of life (QoL). Survival and/or recurrence were expressed as hazard or risk ratios, as second cancer diagnosis and as indicators of QoL such as performance status. We found 53 articles indicating that risk and protective factors can also influence prognosis after cancer diagnosis. Cigarette smoking and, among protective factors, diet and physical activity are the exposures most frequently investigated after a diagnosis of cancer.",

Case Report: We present a case of a 28 year-old female who initially presented with recurrent granular cell tumors of the stomach treated with endoscopic polypectomy. She eventually developed a metachronous lesion within the ascending colon and underwent a segmental colectomy. We present her treatment course, pathological findings, and review of the literature of this unique condition.",

Numerous carcinogenic substances and factors of different natures probably can signify that these carcinogens must start up some common mechanism of normal cells transition into transformed states. Influence of physical, chemical, and biological carcinogenic agents on cells probably are adequate. By our opinion the common mechanism of action of diametrically different carcinogens on target-cells is the destruction of the plasmatic membrane. After influence of different carcinogens, cells\u2019 fusion originates as a result of cytoplasmic membranes perforations (or modifications), i.e. formation in plasma membranes pores, what induces alteration of summary superficial charge of cells\u2019 surface. Because of these, cells acquire ability to approach each other (adhesion), what in many cases may be a premise for fusion process. Thus, the initial target of carcinogenic agents is cells\u2019 plasma membrane, but not the genetic apparatus of cells.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate cancer prevention programs and participants satisfaction in 51 disparities projects in Florida. This three-phase evaluation included evaluability assessment, process, immediate outcome and impact evaluation using qualitative assessment, case study, document analysis, face-to-face interviews, and survey. In 2006-2007, a total of 3,165, and in 2008-2009, a total of 1,632 individuals participated in the programs respectively. In breast and cervical cancer prevention programs, change of proportion of African-American and Haitian recruitment significantly increased from 2006-2008 to 2007-2009 (-11.3 to 3.4). Among other services, all means of outreach such as mobile vans, faith-based activities, health fairs, and small-group education sessions also increased by 5.3%, 7.9%, 5.5%, and 9.4% respectively. In participants' satisfaction the majority of respondents (N=231) were 35-54 years old (46.7%), non-Hispanic Black (81.7%), female (70.3%), high school and some college educated (58.8%), and with income less than $25,000 (65.5%). The majority of the participants were very satisfied with the program staff\u2019s training, cultural sensitivity, language skills, resources, education materials, referral system, and changing behavior (mean score: 4.5-4.7) and with the overall project and the project\u2019s role in improving their quality of life.",

The expression of LAT1, LAT2, and CD98, as well as Ki-67 labeling indices (LI), was analyzed immunohistochemically in first biopsy or TUR samples diagnosed as adenocarcinomas. </p><p>RESULTS: Of the 109 patients, 44 (40%) showed LP on clinical examinations, whereas 65 showed stable disease (SD). LAT1 score and intensity were significantly higher in the LP than in the SD group, as well as among Gleason score (GS)-low (GS &lt; 7) patients who were associated with low-risk. When the LP group was subdivided by D'Amico risk category (low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups), each showed higher LAT1 expression than the SD group. LAT1 expression did not correlate with GS or Ki-67 LI.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Independently of GS, aberrant overexpression of LAT1 in prostatic adenocarcinoma could predict LP under EM.

Mutations in many cancers were discovered in the gene encoding the PI3k catalytic subunit, PIK3CA. </p><p>OBJECTIVE: To date, there has been no report on the association between polymorphism of PIK3CA gene microsatellites and risk of colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigate the relation between the GT dinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the PIK3CA gene and colorectal cancer risk. </p><p>METHODS: A case-control study of 103 colorectal cancer patients and 150 controls was conducted in Iranian people.</p><p>RESULTS: The results of our study demonstrate that PIK3CA gene allele distribution in Iranian population varies between 13 and 20 repeats. Here we demonstrate that individuals who carry alleles shorter than 17 GT repeat are at higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (OR=4.0, p=0), by contrast, those individuals with two alleles longer than 16 GT repeats are at a significantly lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (OR=0.12, p=0). </p><p>CONCLUSION: This result suggests polymorphic GT repeat of PIK3CA gene may be a potential predictive marker of colorectal cancer risk in Iranian population. </p></p><ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"labelName\">Content Type </span><span class=\"labelValue\">Journal Article</span></li><li>Pages -</li><li>DOI 10.3233/CBM-150487</li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Authors</span><ul>\n\t\t<li>Soha Parsafar, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Isfahan, Hezar-Jarib, Isfahan, Iran</li><li>Simin Hematti, Division of Oncology, Medical Sciences University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran</li><li>Fateme Ghorbani, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Isfahan, Hezar-Jarib, Isfahan, Iran</li><li>Forousan Safari, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Isfahan, Hezar-Jarib, Isfahan, Iran</li><li>Manoochehr Tavassoli, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Isfahan, Hezar-Jarib, Isfahan, Iran</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n</ul><ul class=\"parents\">\n\t<ul class=\"details\">\n\t\t<li><span class=\"header labelName\">Journal </span><span class=\"labelValue\"><a href=\"http://iospress.metapress.com/content/113507/\">Cancer Biomarkers</a></span></li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Online ISSN </span><span class=\"labelValue\">1875-8592</span></li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Print ISSN </span><span class=\"labelValue\">1574-0153</span></li>\n\t</ul>\n</ul>",

Recently, miR-21 is found to be aberrantly expressed in CRC and miR-21 has been recognized to perform significantly in CRC, where miR-21 can regulate several different target genes and pathways involving tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. In this study, we will focus on the critical role of miR-21 in CRC. Hopefully, the information obtained may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.</p></p><ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"labelName\">Content Type </span><span class=\"labelValue\">Journal Article</span></li><li>Pages -</li><li>DOI 10.3233/CBM-150468</li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Authors</span><ul>\n\t\t<li>Jun Zhao, Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, Anhui, China</li><li>Guifang Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China</li><li>Yisheng Zhang, Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, Anhui, China</li><li>Guohai Zhao, Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, Anhui, China</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n</ul><ul class=\"parents\">\n\t<ul class=\"details\">\n\t\t<li><span class=\"header labelName\">Journal </span><span class=\"labelValue\"><a href=\"http://iospress.metapress.com/content/113507/\">Cancer Biomarkers</a></span></li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Online ISSN </span><span class=\"labelValue\">1875-8592</span></li><li><span class=\"labelName\">Print ISSN </span><span class=\"labelValue\">1574-0153</span></li>\n\t</ul>\n</ul>",

Initially, melanoma cells respond to PLX4720, but rapid reactivation of ERK/MAPK is observed in areas of high stromal density. This is linked to\u00a0\u201cparadoxical\u201d activation of melanoma-associated fibroblasts by PLX4720 and the promotion of matrix production and remodeling leading to elevated integrin \u03b21/FAK/Src signaling in melanoma cells.

Co-inhibition of BRAF and FAK abolished ERK reactivation and led to more effective control of BRAF-mutant melanoma.

Here, we report a function of TGIF in Wnt signaling. TGIF associates with and diverts Axin1 and Axin2 from the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, therefore allowing \u03b2-catenin accrual. Intriguingly, activation of Wnt signaling induces the expression of TGIF, which unveils a feed-forward loop that ensures effective integration of Wnt signaling. In triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), elevated levels of TGIF correlate with high Wnt signaling and poor survival of patients. Moreover, genetic experiments revealed that Tgif1 ablation impeded mammary tumor development in MMTV-Wnt1 mice, further underscoring a requirement of TGIF for oncogenic Wnt signaling. <br>\n<br>\n Teaser Zhang et\u00a0al. show that TGIF interacts with Axin1 and Axin2, thus preventing them from translocating to cytoplasm to form the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex.

Studying models of therapeutic resistance, we have observed that SCC cells that become refractory to PI3K\u03b1 inhibition maintain PI3K-independent activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This persistent mTOR activation is mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor AXL. AXL is overexpressed in resistant tumors from both laboratory models and patients treated with the PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor BYL719. AXL dimerizes with and phosphorylates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in activation of phospholipase C\u03b3 (PLC\u03b3)-protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, activates mTOR.

We determined that ERG activates the transcriptional program regulated by YAP1 of the Hippo signaling pathway and found that prostate-specific activation of either ERG or YAP1 in mice induces similar transcriptional changes and results in age-related prostate tumors. ERG binds to chromatin regions occupied by TEAD/YAP1 and transactivates Hippo target genes. In addition, in human luminal-type prostate cancer cells, ERG binds to the promoter of YAP1 and is necessary for YAP1 expression. These results provide direct genetic evidence of a causal role for ERG in prostate cancer and reveal a connection between ERG and the Hippo signaling pathway. <br>\n<br>\n Teaser Nguyen et\u00a0al. show that ERG activates YAP1-regulated transcriptional output and that activation of ERG or YAP1 in mouse prostate induces similar transcriptional changes and age-related prostate tumors.

Unfortunately, cures rarely occur and patients display intrinsic or acquired resistance. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting human (h) Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B), a receptor implicated in immune cell desensitization and tumor cell resistance. Fc\u03b3RIIB-blocking antibodies prevented internalization of the CD20-specific antibody rituximab, thereby maximizing cell surface accessibility and immune effector cell mediated antitumor activity. In hFc\u03b3RIIB-transgenic (Tg) mice, Fc\u03b3RIIB-blocking antibodies effectively deleted target cells in combination with rituximab, and other therapeutic antibodies, from resistance-prone stromal compartments. Similar efficacy was seen in primary human tumor xenografts, including with cells from patients with relapsed/refractory disease. These data support the further development of hFc\u03b3RIIB antibodies for clinical assessment. <br>\n Graphical abstract <br>\n Teaser Roghanian et\u00a0al. show that antibodies blocking Fc\u03b3RIIB prevent internalization of anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, thereby maximizing immune effector cell-mediated antitumor activity.

Cancer cell-restricted genetic ablation of murine TRAIL-R in autochthonous KRAS-driven models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reduces tumor growth, blunts metastasis, and prolongs survival by inhibiting cancer cell-autonomous migration, proliferation, and invasion.

These immune checkpoint pathways, which normally maintain self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during anti-microbial immune responses, can be co-opted by cancer to evade immune destruction. Drugs interrupting immune checkpoints, such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and others in early development, can unleash anti-tumor immunity and mediate durable cancer regressions.

Interestingly, the normal bystander cells acquired gene expression patterns resembling their malignant counterparts. Therefore, much of the leukemia signature is mediated by extrinsic factors.

Here, we provide the genetic evidence that telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage drives classical MDS phenotypes and alters common myeloid progenitor (CMP) differentiation by repressing the expression of mRNA splicing/processing genes, including SRSF2. RNA-seq analyses of telomere dysfunctional CMP identified aberrantly spliced transcripts linked to pathways relevant to MDS pathogenesis such as genome stability, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and histone modification, which are also enriched in mouse CMP haploinsufficient for SRSF2 and in CD34+ CMML patient cells harboring SRSF2 mutation.

It is unclear how these mutations contribute to disease. We examined in\u00a0vivo hematopoietic consequences of the most common U2AF1 mutation using a doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse model. Mice expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F) display altered hematopoiesis and changes in pre-mRNA splicing in hematopoietic progenitor cells by whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq). Integration with human RNA-seq datasets determined that common mutant U2AF1-induced splicing alterations are enriched in RNA processing genes, ribosomal genes, and recurrently mutated MDS and acute myeloid leukemia-associated genes.

Our study reveals that the TGFBR1 inhibitor SD208 effectively reduces prostate cancer bone metastases. TGF-\u03b2 upregulates in prostate cancer cells a set of genes associated with cancer aggressiveness and bone metastases, and the most upregulated gene was PMEPA1. In patients, PMEPA1 expression decreased in metastatic prostate cancer and low Pmepa1 correlated with decreased metastasis-free survival. Only membrane-anchored isoforms of PMEPA1 interacted with R-SMADs and ubiquitin ligases, blocking TGF-\u03b2 signaling independently of the proteasome.

These results suggest that PF-06463922 will be highly effective for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven lung cancers, including those who relapsed on clinically available ALK inhibitors because of secondary ALK kinase domain mutations and/or brain metastases. <br>\n<br>\n Teaser Zou et\u00a0al. show that PF-06463922, an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, is effective against all known clinical ALK mutants. Moreover, PF-06463922 is effective against brain metastases of EML4-ALK-driven tumors and has high safety margins in preclinical studies.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

There are, however, little data to suggest that these alterations have clinical relevance. We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (including next-generation sequencing) of 79 stage IV SQCLCs and analyzed differences in the clinical characteristics of two major SQCLC subtypes: FGFR1 amplified and PI3K aberrant. Patients with PI3K-aberrant tumors had aggressive disease marked by worse survival (median overall survival, 8.6 vs. 19.1 months, P < 0.001), higher metastatic burden (>3 organs, 18% vs. 3%, P = 0.025), and greater incidence of brain metastases (27% vs. 0% in others, P < 0.001). We performed whole-exome and RNA sequencing on paired brain metastases and primary lung cancers to elucidate the metastatic process to brain. SQCLC primaries that gave rise to brain metastases exhibited truncal PTEN loss. SQCLC brain metastases exhibited a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and evidence of clonal differences between their primary sites.\n\nSignificance: We performed next-generation sequencing of metastatic SQCLCs and primary lung&ndash;brain metastasis pairs, identifying PI3K-aberrant tumors as an aggressive subset associated with brain metastases.

Sym004 is a two-antibody mixture targeting nonoverlapping EGFR epitopes.

In this phase I trial, we observed grade 3 skin toxicity and hypomagnesemia as mechanism-based dose-limiting events during dose escalation. In dose-expansion cohorts of 9 and 12 mg/kg of Sym004 weekly, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and acquired EGFR inhibitor resistance were enrolled; 17 of 39 patients (44%) had tumor shrinkage, with 5 patients (13%) achieving partial response.

Cellular adaptation to ER stress is mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR), which aims at restoring ER homeostasis. The UPR has emerged as a major pathway in remodeling cancer gene expression, thereby either preventing cell transformation or providing an advantage to transformed cells. UPR sensors are highly regulated by the formation of dynamic protein scaffolds, leading to integrated reprogramming of the cells. Herein, we describe the regulatory mechanisms underlying UPR signaling upon cell intrinsic or extrinsic challenges, and how they engage cell transformation programs and/or provide advantages to cancer cells, leading to enhanced aggressiveness or chemoresistance. We discuss the emerging cross-talk between the UPR and related metabolic processes to ensure maintenance of protein homeostasis and its impact on cell transformation and tumor growth.<br>\n<br>\nSignificance: ER stress signaling is dysregulated in many forms of cancer and contributes to tumor growth as a survival factor, in addition to modulating other disease-associated processes, including cell migration, cell transformation, and angiogenesis.

HIF2&alpha;-dependent PLIN2 expression promoted lipid storage, proliferation, and viability in xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, lipid storage maintained integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is functionally and physically associated with LDs.

                "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase domain mutations are a common cause of acquired clinical resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used to treat cancer, including the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib. Mutation of kinase \"gatekeeper\" residues, which control access to an allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site, has been frequently implicated in TKI resistance. The molecular underpinnings of gatekeeper mutation&ndash;mediated resistance are incompletely understood. We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with the TKI quizartinib, which demonstrates that quizartinib binding relies on essential edge-to-face aromatic interactions with the gatekeeper F691 residue, and F830 within the highly conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif in the activation loop. This reliance makes quizartinib critically vulnerable to gatekeeper and activation loop substitutions while minimizing the impact of mutations elsewhere. Moreover, we identify PLX3397, a novel FLT3 inhibitor that retains activity against the F691L mutant due to a binding mode that depends less vitally on specific interactions with the gatekeeper position.<br>\n<br>\nSignificance: We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with a kinase inhibitor, elucidating the structural mechanism of resistance due to the gatekeeper F691L mutation.

                "abstract": "Although p53 transcriptional activation potential is critical for its ability to suppress cancer, the specific target genes involved in tumor suppression remain unclear. SIVA is a p53 target gene essential for p53-dependent apoptosis, although it can also promote proliferation through inhibition of p53 in some settings. Thus, the role of SIVA in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we seek to define the contribution of SIVA to tumorigenesis by generating Siva conditional knockout mice. Surprisingly, we find that SIVA loss inhibits non&ndash;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development, suggesting that SIVA facilitates tumorigenesis. Similarly, SIVA knockdown in mouse and human NSCLC cell lines decreases proliferation and transformation. Consistent with this protumorigenic role for SIVA, high-level SIVA expression correlates with reduced NSCLC patient survival. SIVA acts independently of p53 and, instead, stimulates mTOR signaling and metabolism in NSCLC cells. Thus, SIVA enables tumorigenesis in a p53-independent manner, revealing a potential new cancer therapy target.<br>\n<br>\nSignificance: These findings collectively reveal a novel role for the p53 target gene SIVA both in regulating metabolism and in enabling tumorigenesis, independently of p53. Importantly, these studies further identify SIVA as a new prognostic marker and as a potential target for NSCLC cancer therapy.

Surprisingly, we found that this metastasis is driven by MYC, and not AKT, activation. Here, we show that cell&ndash;cell communication by IL6 drives the AKT&ndash;MYC switch through activation of the AKT-suppressing phosphatase PHLPP2, when PTEN and p53 are lost together, but not separately. IL6 then communicates a downstream program of STAT3-mediated MYC activation, which drives cell proliferation. Similarly, in tissues, peak proliferation in Pten/Trp53&ndash;mutant primary and metastatic prostate cancer does not correlate with activated AKT, but with STAT3/MYC activation instead. Mechanistically, MYC strongly activates the AKT phosphatase PHLPP2 in primary cells and prostate cancer metastasis. We show genetically that Phlpp2 is essential for dictating the proliferation of MYC-mediated AKT suppression. Collectively, our data reveal competition between two proto-oncogenes, MYC and AKT, which ensnarls the Phlpp2 gene to facilitate MYC-driven prostate cancer metastasis after loss of Pten and Trp53.<br>\n<br>\nSignificance: Our data identify IL6 detection as a potential causal biomarker for MYC-driven metastasis after loss of PTEN and p53.

However, DNA extracted from FFPE tumors (FFPE DNA) is problematic for mutational testing, especially for amplicon-based massively parallel sequencing (MPS), owing to DNA fragmentation and artificial C:G&gt;T:A single nucleotide variants (SNVs) caused by deamination of cytosine to uracil. Therefore, to reduce artificial C:G&gt;T:A SNVs in amplicon-based MPS using FFPE DNA, we evaluated the efficacy of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG)-pretreatment, which can eliminate uracil-containing DNA molecules, with 126 archived FFPE esophageal cancer specimens. We also examined the association between the frequency of C:G&gt;T:A SNVs and DNA quality, as assessed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assay. UDG-pretreatment significantly lowered the frequency of C:G&gt;T:A SNVs in highly fragmented DNA (by approximately 60%). This effect was not observed for good-to-moderate quality DNA, suggesting that a predictive assay (i.e., DNA quality assessment) needs to be performed prior to UDG-pretreatment. These results suggest that UDG-pretreatment is efficacious for mutational testing by amplicon-based MPS with fragmented DNA from FFPE samples. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Subsequently occurring regulatory processes can induce an aberrant stimulation of the DNA- methyltransferase (DNMT1) as well as changes in histone deacetylases (HDACs) and microRNAs in many cancer cell lines. Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway are increasingly recognized as anti-cancer drugs. There is an extending evidence indicating an intense cross-talk between signaling pathways, which affect growth, differentiation and apoptosis either directly or indirectly via epigenetic mechanisms. Here we show data obtained by novel transcriptomic and corresponding methylomic or proteomic analyses from cell lines treated with pharmacologic doses of respective inhibitors (simvastatin, ibandronate). Metabolic pathways and their epigenetic consequences appear to be affected by a changed concentration of NADPH. Moreover, since the mevalonate metabolism is part of a signaling network including vitamin D metabolism or fatty acid synthesis, the epigenetic activity of associated pathways is also being presented. This underlines the far-reaching epigenetic impact of metabolic therapies on cancer cells and provides some explanation for clinical observations, which indicate an anti-cancer activity of statins and bisphosphonates. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

KRAS coding exons in 61 treatment-naive colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors and KRAS, EGFR, ALK, and MET in lung tumors from three Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were sequenced using ultradeep sequencing methods. Forty-one percent of CRC patients (25/61) harbored mutations in the KRAS active domain, eight of which (13%) were not detected by Sanger sequencing. Three (of eight) had frequencies less than 10% and one patient harbored more than one mutation. Low frequency KRAS active (G12R) and EGFR kinase domain mutations (G719A) were identified in one NSCLC patient. A second NSCLC patient showed an EML4-ALK fusion with ALK, EGFR, and MET mutations. A third NSCLC patient harbored multiple low frequency mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and MET as well as ALK gene copy number increases. Within the same patient, multiple low frequency mutations occurred within a gene. A complex pattern of intrinsic low frequency driver mutations in well-known tumor oncogenes may exist prior to treatment, resulting in resistance to targeted therapies. Ultradeep sequencing can characterize intratumor heterogeneity and identify such mutations to ultimately affect treatment decisions. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Squire<br>\n<br>\n We present a meta-analysis of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) from 11 publications that examined 662 prostate cancer patient samples, which were derived from 546 primary and 116 advanced tumors. Normalization, segmentation, and identification of corresponding CNAs for meta-analysis was achieved using established commercial software. Unsupervised analysis identified five genomic subgroups in which approximately 90% of the samples were characterized by abnormal profiles with gains of 8q. The most common loss was 8p (NKX3.1). The CNA distribution in other genomic subgroups was characterized by losses at 2q, 3p, 5q, 6q, 13q, 16q, 17p, 18q, and PTEN (10q), and acquisition of 21q deletions associated with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangement. Parallel analysis of advanced and primary tumors in the cohort indicated that genomic deletions of PTEN and the gene fusion were enriched in advanced disease. A supervised analysis of the PTEN deletion and the fusion gene showed that PTEN deletion was sufficient to impose higher levels of CNA. Moreover, the overall percentage of the genome altered was significantly higher when PTEN was deleted, suggesting that this important genomic subgroup was likely characterized by intrinsic chromosomal instability. Predicted alterations in expression levels of candidate genes in each of the recurrent CNA regions characteristic of each subgroup showed that signaling networks associated with cancer progression and genome stability were likely to be perturbed at the highest level in the PTEN deleted genomic subgroup. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

However, direct in vivo evidence for the role of EMT in the formation of cancer stem\u2013like cells (CSC) and the metastatic cascade remains lacking. Here we report the first isolation and characterization of mesenchymal-like and EMT tumor cells, which harbor both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, in an autochthonous murine model of prostate cancer. By crossing the established Pb-Cre+/\u2212;PtenL/L;KrasG12D/+ prostate cancer model with a vimentin-GFP reporter strain, generating CPKV mice, we were able to isolate epithelial, EMT, and mesenchymal-like cancer cells based on expression of vimentin and EpCAM. CPKV mice (but not mice with Pten deletion alone) exhibited expansion of cells with EMT (EpCAM+/Vim-GFP+) and mesenchymal-like (EpCAM\u2212/Vim-GFP+) characteristics at the primary tumor site and in circulation. These EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells displayed enhanced stemness and invasive character compared with epithelial tumor cells. Moreover, they displayed an enriched tumor-initiating capacity and could regenerate epithelial glandular structures in vivo, indicative of epithelia\u2013mesenchyme plasticity. Interestingly, while mesenchymal-like tumor cells could persist in circulation and survive in the lung following intravenous injection, only epithelial and EMT tumor cells could form macrometastases. Our work extends the evidence that mesenchymal and epithelial states in cancer cells contribute differentially to their capacities for tumor initiation and metastatic seeding, respectively, and that EMT tumor cells exist with plasticity that can contribute to multiple stages of the metastatic cascade.

MEK inhibitors improve survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest efficacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET, the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by conditioned medium from fibroblasts that produce NRG1 and HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET. Together, these results provide preclinical evidence for the use of MEK inhibitors in combination with clinical-grade anti-ERBB3 or anti-cMET monoclonal antibodies in metastatic uveal melanoma.

In this study, we used kinase profiling analysis to demonstrate that 2\u2032-hydroxycinnamicaldehyde (2\u2032-HCA), a compound found in cinnamon, specifically inhibits Pim-1 activity. Cocrystallography studies determined the hydrogen bonding pattern between 2\u2032-HCA and Pim-1. Notably, 2\u2032-HCA binding altered the apo kinase structure in a manner that shielded the ligand from solvent, thereby acting as a gatekeeper loop.

The compound was also effective as a chemopreventive agent against EGF-mediated neoplastic transformation.

According to this model, hepatocytic bilirubin glucuronide can follow a liver-to-blood shuttling loop via Abcc3 transporter-mediated efflux and subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated liver uptake. We hypothesized that glucuronide conjugates of xenobiotics, such as the anticancer drug sorafenib, can also undergo hepatocyte hopping. Using transporter-deficient mouse models, we show here that sorafenib-glucuronide can be extruded from hepatocytes into the bile by Abcc2 or back into the systemic circulation by Abcc3, and that it can be taken up efficiently again into neighboring hepatocytes by Oatp1a/1b. We further demonstrate that sorafenib-glucuronide excreted into the gut lumen can be cleaved by microbial enzymes to sorafenib, which is then reabsorbed, supporting its persistence in the systemic circulation. Our results suggest broad relevance of a hepatocyte shuttling process known as \u201chepatocyte hopping\u201d\u2014a novel concept in clinical pharmacology\u2014for detoxification of targeted cancer drugs that undergo hepatic glucuronidation, such as sorafenib.

In this study, we show how its genetic amplification in PTEN-deficient melanomas may rationalize the use of CDK2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy. Analysis of array-CGH data revealed that PTEN deficiency is coupled tightly with genomic amplification encompassing the NUAK2 locus, a finding strengthened by immunohistochemical evidence that phospho-Akt overexpression was correlated with NUAK2 expression in clinical specimens of acral melanoma. Functional studies in melanoma cells showed that inactivation of the PI3K pathway upregulated p21 expression and reduced the number of cells in S phase. NUAK2 silencing and inactivation of the PI3K pathway efficiently controlled CDK2 expression, whereas CDK2 inactivation specifically abrogated the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed an association of CDK2 expression with NUAK2 amplification and p-Akt expression in melanomas. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 was sufficient to suppress the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results show how CDK2 blockade may offer a promising therapy for genetically defined melanomas, where NUAK2 is amplified and PTEN is deleted.

NKX3.1, a prostate tumor suppressor that accelerates the DNA repair response, binds to androgen receptor at the ERG gene breakpoint and inhibits both the juxtaposition of the TMPRSS2 and ERG gene loci and also their recombination. NKX3.1 acts by accelerating DNA repair after androgen-induced transcriptional activation. NKX3.1 influences the recruitment of proteins that promote homology-directed DNA repair. Loss of NKX3.1 favors recruitment to the ERG gene breakpoint of proteins that promote error-prone nonhomologous end-joining. Analysis of prostate cancer tissues showed that the presence of a TMPRSS2\u2013ERG rearrangement was highly correlated with lower levels of NKX3.1 expression consistent with the role of NKX3.1 as a suppressor of the pathogenic gene rearrangement.

Prior reports demonstrated that BRCA1 recruitment to areas of DNA breakage depended on RAP80 and the RNF8/RNF168 E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we extend these findings by showing that RAP80 is only required for the binding of BRCA1 to regions flanking the DSB, whereas BRCA1 binding directly to DNA breaks requires Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1). These differential recruitment mechanisms differentially affect BRCA1 functions: (i) RAP80-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 to chromatin flanking DNA breaks is required for BRCA1 phosphorylation at serine 1387 and 1423 by ATM and, consequently, for the activation of S and G2 checkpoints; and (ii) BRCA1 interaction with NBS1 upon DSB induction results in an NBS1-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 directly to the DNA break and is required for nonhomologous end-joining repair. Together, these findings illustrate that spatially distinct fractions of BRCA1 exist at the DSB site, which are recruited by different mechanisms and execute different functions in the DDR.

Here, we show that miR-181a-5p is downregulated in aggressive human breast and colon cancers where its levels correlate inversely with MMP-14 expression. In clinical specimens, enhanced expression of MMP-14 was observed in cancer cells located at the invasive front of tumors where miR-181a-5p was downregulated relative to adjacent normal cells. Bioinformatics analyses defined a potential miR-181a-5p response element within the 3\u2032-untranslated region of MMP-14 that was validated in reporter gene experiments. Ectopic miR-181a-5p reduced MMP-14 expression, whereas miR-181a-5p attenuation elevated MMP-14 expression. In support of a critical relationship between these two genes, miR-181a-5p\u2013mediated reduction of MMP-14 levels was sufficient to decrease cancer cell migration, invasion, and activation of pro-MMP-2. Furthermore, this reduction in MMP-14 levels was sufficient to reduce in vivo invasion and angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. Taken together, our results establish the regulation of MMP-14 in cancers by miR-181a-5p through a posttranscriptional mechanism, and they further suggest strategies to elevate miR-181a-5p to prevent cancer metastasis.

However, the basis for such effects, associated with either primary or metastatic tumors, are generally poorly understood. In this study, we show how heart and kidney vascular function is impaired by neutrophils that accumulate in those tissues as a result of tumor formation in two different transgenic mouse models of cancer (RIP1-Tag2 model of insulinoma and MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer). Neutrophil depletion by systemic administration of an anti-Gr1 antibody improved vascular perfusion and prevented vascular leakage in kidney vessels. We also observed the accumulation of platelet\u2013neutrophil complexes, a signature of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), in the kidneys of tumor-bearing mice that were completely absent from healthy nontumor-bearing littermates. NET accumulation in the vasculature was associated with upregulation of the proinflammatory adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, as well as the proinflammatory cytokines IL1\u03b2, IL6, and the chemokine CXCL1. Administering DNase I to dissolve NETs, which have a high DNA content, restored perfusion in the kidney and heart to levels seen in nontumor-bearing mice, and also prevented vessel leakage in the blood vasculature of these organs. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that NETs mediate the negative collateral effects of tumors on distal organs, acting to impair vascular function, and to heighten inflammation at these sites.

Consequently, HB-EGF\u2013treated cells exhibit higher double-strand break (DSB) rejoining and display lower levels of residual DSBs. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection induce DSBs along with elevation in the number of macrophages and HB-EGF expression.

                "abstract": "A key challenge in the field of T-cell immunotherapy for cancer is creating a suitable platform for promoting differentiation of effector cells while at the same time enabling self-renewal needed for long-term memory. Although transfer of less differentiated memory T cells increases efficacy through greater expansion and persistence in vivo, the capacity of such cells to sustain effector functions within immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments may still be limiting. We have therefore directly compared the impact of effector versus memory differentiation of therapeutic T cells in tumor-bearing mice by introducing molecular switches that regulate cell fate decisions via mTOR. Ectopic expression of RAS homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) increased mTORC1 signaling, promoted a switch to aerobic glycolysis, and increased expansion of effector T cells. By rapidly infiltrating tumors, RHEB-transduced T cells significantly reduced the emergence of immunoedited escape variants. In contrast, expression of proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) inhibited mTORC1, promoted quiescence, and blocked tumor infiltration. Fate mapping studies following transient expression of PRAS40 demonstrated that mTORC1low T cells made no contribution to initial tumor control but instead survived to become memory cells proficient in generating recall immunity. Our data support the design of translational strategies for generating heterogeneous T-cell immunity against cancer, with the appropriate balance between promoting effector differentiation and self-renewal. Unlike pharmacologic inhibitors, the genetic approach described here allows for upregulation as well as inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway and is highly selective for the therapeutic T cells without affecting systemic mTORC1 functions.

In this study, we report a role of chemotherapy-derived inflammatory response in the enrichment of PDAC microenvironment with immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a major cytokine associated with oncogenic KRAS in PDAC cells. GM-CSF production was significantly enhanced in various PDAC cell lines or PDAC tumor tissues from patients after treatment with chemotherapy, which induced the differentiation of monocytes into myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Furthermore, blockade of GM-CSF with monoclonal antibodies helped to restore T-cell proliferation when cocultured with monocytes stimulated with tumor supernatants. GM-CSF expression was also observed in primary tumors and correlated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Together, these results describe a role of GM-CSF in the modification of chemotherapy-treated PDAC microenvironment and suggest that the targeting of GM-CSF may benefit PDAC patients' refractory to current anticancer regimens by defeating MDSC-mediated immune escape.

Herein, the tumor growth of melanoma cell lines expressing major histocompatibility complex class I molecules at high levels (MHC-Ihigh) was dramatically impaired in TNF-deficient mice, and this was associated with enhanced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes. Immunodepletion of CD8 T cells fully restored melanoma growth in TNF\u2212/\u2212 mice. Systemic administration of Etanercept inhibited MHC-Ihigh melanoma growth in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient (IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212, nude, or CD8\u2212/\u2212) mice. MHC-Ihigh melanoma growth was also reduced in mice lacking TNF-R1, but not TNF-R2. TNF\u2212/\u2212 and TNF-R1\u2212/\u2212 mice as well as Etanercept-treated WT mice displayed enhanced intratumor content of high endothelial venules surrounded by high CD8+ T-cell density. Adoptive transfer of activated TNF-R1\u2013deficient or \u2013proficient CD8+ T cells in CD8-deficient mice bearing B16K1 tumors demonstrated that TNF-R1 deficiency facilitates the accumulation of live CD8+ T cells into the tumors.

The understanding of the cell fate determination during development and tumor-genesis remains challenging in current cancer biology. It was suggested that cancer stem cell (CSC) may arise from normal stem cells or be transformed from normal differentiated cells. This gives hints on the connection between cancer and development. However, the molecular mechanisms of these cell-type transitions and the CSC formation remain elusive. We quantified landscape, dominant paths, and switching rates between cell types from a core gene regulatory network for cancer and development. Stem cell, CSC, cancer, and normal cell types emerge as basins of attraction on associated landscape. The dominant paths quantify the transition processes among CSC, stem cell, normal cell, and cancer cell attractors. Transition actions of the dominant paths are shown to be closely related to switching rates between cell types, but not always to the barriers in between, because of the presence of the curl flux. During the process of P53 gene activation, landscape topography changes gradually from a CSC attractor to a normal cell attractor. This confirms the roles of P53 of preventing the formation of CSC through suppressing self-renewal and inducing differentiation. By global sensitivity analysis according to landscape topography and action, we identified key regulations determining cell-type switchings and suggested testable predictions. From landscape view, the emergence of the CSCs and the associated switching to other cell types are the results of underlying interactions among cancer and developmental marker genes. This indicates that the cancer and development are intimately connected. This landscape and flux theoretical framework provides a quantitative way to understand the underlying mechanisms of CSC formation and interplay between cancer and development.

Identical EGFR genotypes were found in matched pairs of ISP and associated SNSCC, providing the first genetic evidence of a biologic link between these tumors. EGFR mutations were not identified in exophytic or oncocytic papillomas or non\u2013ISP-associated SNSCC, suggesting that the ISP/SNSCC spectrum is biologically distinct among sinonasal squamous tumors. Patients with ISP harboring EGFR mutations also exhibited an increased progression-free survival compared with those with wild-type EGFR. Finally, treatment of ISP-associated carcinoma cells with irreversible EGFR inhibitors resulted in inactivation of EGFR signaling and growth inhibition. These findings implicate a prominent role for activating EGFR mutations in the pathogenesis of ISP and associated SNSCC and rationalize consideration of irreversible EGFR inhibitors in the therapy of these tumors.

This study aimed to develop a LAT1\u2010mediated chemotherapeutic agents. Here we screened about 7 large neutral amino acid modified doxorubicin. After screening, the aspartate modified doxorubicin (Asp\u2010DOX) showed the highest affinity (Km = 41.423 \u03bcmol/L) to LAT1. Here, aspartate was attached to the N\u2010terminal of DOX via the amido bond with a free carboxyl and a free amino group on the \u03b1\u2010carbon atom of the Asp residue. The product Asp\u2010DOX was characterized by HPLC/MS. In vitro, the Asp\u2010DOX exerted stronger inhibition to the cancer cells overexpressing LAT1 and the uptake of Asp\u2010DOX was about 3.5\u2010fold higher than that of DOX in HepG2 cells. Data of Pharmacokinetics showed that What\u2019 more, Asp\u2010DOX expressed a longer circulation time (t1/2 = 49.14 min) in the blood compared to DOX (t1/2 = 15.12 min). In HepG2 and HCT116 tumor\u2010bearing mice, Asp\u2010DOX achieved 3.1\u2010fold and 6.4\u2010fold accumulation of drugs in tumor tissue than those of the unmodified DOX. More importantly, treatment of tumor\u2010bearing mice with Asp\u2010DOX showed a significantly stronger inhibition to in tumor growth than mice treated with free DOX in HepG2 tumor models. Furthermore, after Asp modification, Asp\u2010DOX avoided the mutiple drug resistance mediated by was not yet the substrate of P\u2010gp. These results suggested that the Asp\u2010DOX modified drug may provide a new treatment strategy for tumors which overexpress LAT1 and MDR1.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In order to determine the clinical significance of DJ\u20101 protein in the sera of breast cancer patients, we examined blood samples from a breast cancer group (n=180) and a non\u2010cancerous control group (n=300). Higher levels of DJ\u20101 were detected in the breast cancer group (mean level; 42.7 ng/mL) than the control group (28.3 ng/mL) by an enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (P=0.019). Higher DJ\u20101 levels were significantly associated with advanced clinical grade, according to the TNM classification, negative hormone receptor status, and high Ki\u201067 labeling index, of biopsied materials; samples showed low DJ\u20101 protein expression despite upregulated DJ\u20101 mRNA. DJ\u20101 isoforms could be detected clearly in 17 blood samples (from 11 breast cancer, and 6 non\u2010cancerous patients) by two\u2010dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. The isoform at the isoelectric point (pI) of 6.3 showed the highest intensity in all 11 cancer cases. Conversely, in the 6 non\u2010cancerous cases, isoforms other than the pI 6.3 isoform were highly expressed, and there was a significant difference in the isoform pattern between breast cancer cases and controls (P = 0.00025). These data indicate that high levels of DJ\u20101, probably of isoform at pI 6.3 is a candidate for serum marker of breast cancer.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

                "abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that degrades the essential amino acid l\u2010tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway, exerts immunomodulatory effects in a number of diseases. IDO expression is increased in tumor tissue and in draining lymph nodes; this increase is thought to play a role in tumor evasion by suppressing the immune response. A competitive inhibitor of IDO is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory solid tumors, but the efficacy of IDO inhibition in colorectal tumors remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of IDO deficiency on colon tumorigenesis in mice by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition. Ido1\u2010deficient(\u2010/\u2010) mice were crossed with ApcMin/+ mice or were administered azoxymethane with or without dextran sodium sulfate. Ido1 deficiency did not lead to significant differences in the size and number of colon tumors. Similarly, the pharmacological inhibition of IDO using 1\u2010methyltryptophan (1\u2010mT) also resulted in no significant differences in tumor size and number in ApcMin/+ mice. However, Ido1 deficiency altered the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, showing a significant increase in mRNA expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease in the number of Foxp3\u2010positive regulatory T cells in the colon tumors of Ido1(\u2010/\u2010) mice. Importantly, 1\u2010mT treatment also significantly altered cytokine expression in the colon tumor tissues. These results suggest that IDO inhibition alone cannot sufficiently suppress colon cancer development in mice despite its immunomodulatory activity in the tumor microenvironment.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The active FA core complex acts as an E3 ligase that monoubiquitinates FANCD2, which is a functional readout of an activated FA pathway. In this study, we aimed to identify FANCD2\u2010targeting agents, and reported that a natural compound celastrol, induced degradation of FANCD2 through ubiquitin\u2010proteasome pathway. We demonstrated that celastrol down\u2010regulated the basal and DNA damaging agents\u2010induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2, followed by proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, celastrol treatment abrogated the G2 checkpoint induced by IR, and enhanced the ICL agents\u2010induced DNA damage and inhibitory effects on lung cancer cells through depletion of FANCD2. These results indicate that celastrol is a FANCD2 inhibitor that could interfere with the monoubiquitination and protein stability of FANCD2, providing a novel opportunity to develop FA pathway inhibitor and combinational therapy for malignant neoplasms.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

We investigated the association between active and passive smoking and risk of all\u2010cause and breast cancer\u2010specific death among female breast cancer patients in relation to menopausal and tumor estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status. This study included 848 patients admitted to a single hospital in Japan from 1997 to 2007. Active or passive smoking status was assessed using a self\u2010administered questionnaire. The patients were followed until December 31, 2010. We used Cox proportional\u2010hazard model to estimate hazard ratio (HR). During a median follow\u2010up period of 6.7 years, 170 all\u2010cause and 132 breast cancer\u2010specific deaths were observed. Among premenopausal patients, current smokers showed a non\u2010significant higher risk of all\u2010cause and breast cancer\u2010specific death.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A directly inhibits the retention of 53BP1 at DSB sites by acetylating histone H4 (H4ac), which interferes with 53BP1 binding to dimethylated histone H4 Lys20 (H4K20me2). Conversely, we recently found that the retention of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is also affected by another methylated histone residue, H3K9me2, which can be suppressed by the histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT) inhibitor UNC0638. Here, we investigate the effects of the Class I HDAC inhibitors MS\u2010275 and FK228 compared to UNC0638 on histone modifications and the DNA damage response. In addition to H4ac, the HDAC inhibitors induce H3K9ac and inhibit H3K9me2 at doses that do not affect the expression levels of DNA repair genes. By contrast, UNC0638 selectively inhibits H3K9me2 without affecting the levels of H3K9ac, H3K56ac or H4ac. Reflecting their effects on histone modifications, the HDAC inhibitors inhibit ionizing radiation\u2010induced foci (IRIF) formation of BRCA1 and BARD1 as well as 53BP1 and RIF1, whereas UNC0638 suppresses IRIF formation of BRCA1 and BARD1 but not 53BP1 and RIF1. Although HDAC inhibitors suppressed HDR, they did not cooperate with the poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib to block cancer cell growth, possibly due to simultaneous suppression of NHEJ pathway components. Collectively, these results suggest the mechanism by that HDAC inhibitors inhibit both the HDR and NHEJ pathways, whereas HKMT inhibitor inhibits only the HDR pathway; this finding may affect the chemo\u2010sensitizing effects of the inhibitors.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Currently, there are no biomarkers that can be used to diagnose asbestos exposure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the levels or detection rate of chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) in the serum are elevated in persons exposed to asbestos. The primary study group consisted of 76 healthy subjects not exposed to asbestos and 172 healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos. The secondary study group consisted of 535 subjects possibly exposed to asbestos and diagnosed with pleural plaque (412), benign hydrothorax (10), asbestosis (86), lung cancer (17), and malignant mesothelioma (10). All study subjects who were possibly exposed to asbestos had a certificate of asbestos exposure issued by the Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare. For the primary study group, levels of serum CCL3 did not differ between the two groups. However, the detection rate of CCL3 in the serum of healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos (30.2%) was significantly higher (p<0.001) than for the control group (6.6%). The pleural plaque, benign hydrothorax, asbestosis, and lung cancer groups had serum CCL3 levels and detection rates similar to that of healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos. CCL3 was detected in the serum of nine of the ten patients diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. Three of the patients with malignant mesothelioma had exceptionally high CCL3 levels. Malignant mesothelioma cells from four biopsy cases and an autopsy case were positive for CCL3, possibly identifying the source of the CCL3 in the three malignant mesothelioma patients with exceptionally high serum CCL3 levels. In conclusion, a significantly higher percentage of healthy persons possibly exposed to asbestos had detectable levels of serum CCL3 compared to healthy unexposed control subjects.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Interleukin (IL)\u201027, a member of the IL\u201012 heterodimeric cytokine family, has pleiotropic functions in the regulation of immune responses with both pro\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties. Numbers of evidence obtained by using a variety of preclinical mouse models indicates that IL\u201027 possesses potent antitumor activity against various types of tumors through multiple mechanisms without apparent adverse effects. These mechanisms include those mediated not only by CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages but also by antibody\u2010dependent cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity, antiangiogenesis, direct antiproliferative effect, inhibition of expression of cyclooxygenase\u20102 and prostaglandin E2, and suppression of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, depending on the characteristics of individual tumors.

Furthermore, we investigated the functional role of P\u2010cadherin in these cancer cells by knockdown and overexpression in vitro and by analyzing the correlation between the P\u2010cadherin expression and its promoter methylation status. Thirty of 59 ICC cases (51%) and 36 of 73 pancreatic cancer cases (49%) stained positive for P\u2010cadherin with mainly membranous distribution in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. P\u2010cadherin expression was significantly correlated with several clinicopathological factors, which reflect tumor behavior, and was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease\u2010free survival in patients with ICC (relative risk [RR] 2.93, p = 0.04) and pancreatic cancer (RR 2.68, p = 0.005) via a multivariate analyses.

P\u2010cadherin expression was related to its promoter methylation status in both cell lines and cancer tissues. In summary, P\u2010cadherin overexpression may serve as a useful biomarker of invasive phenotype and poor prognosis; P\u2010cadherin expression was found to be regulated by its promoter methylation.

We found that a novel amplification at the chromosomal region 3q26 occurs in the HCC cell line, JHH\u20101, and that MECOM (MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus), which lies within the 3q26 region, was amplified. Quantitative PCR analysis of the three transcripts transcribed from MECOM indicated that only EVI1, but not the fusion transcript MDS1\u2010EVI1 or MDS1, was overexpressed in JHH\u20101 cells and was significantly up\u2010regulated in 22 (61%) of 36 primary HCC tumors when compared with their non\u2010tumorous counterparts. A copy number gain of EVI1 was observed in 24 (36%) of 66 primary HCC tumors. High EVI1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and higher level of des\u2010\u03b3\u2010carboxy prothrombin (DCP), a tumor marker for HCC. Knockdown of EVI1 resulted in increased induction of the cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitor p15INK4B by transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2010\u03b2 and decreased expression of c\u2010Myc, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated Rb in TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010treated cells. Consequently, knockdown of EVI1 led to reduced DNA synthesis and cell viability.

Although EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF are considered major targets for colon cancer treatment, the precise roles of the MEK\u2010ERK pathway, one of their major downstream effectors, during colon cancer development, remain to be determined. Using Apc\u0394716 mice, a mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis and early stage of sporadic colon cancer formation, we show that the MEK\u2010ERK signaling is activated not only in adenoma epithelial cells, but also in tumor stromal cells including fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. Eight\u2010week treatment of Apc\u0394716 mice with trametinib, a small\u2010molecule MEK inhibitor significantly reduced the number of polyps in the large size class, accompanied by reduced angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Trametinib treatment reduced the cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) level in Apc\u0394716 tumors in vivo, and in primary culture of intestinal fibroblasts in vitro. Antibody array analysis revealed that trametinib and the COX\u20102 inhibitor rofecoxib both reduced the level of CCL2, a chemokine known to be essential for the growth of Apc mutant polyps, in intestinal fibroblasts in vitro.

                "abstract": "Targeted therapy is a rational and promising strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer. For the development of clinical agents targeting oncogenic signaling pathways, it is important to define the specificity of compounds to the target molecular pathway. Genome\u2010wide transcriptomic analysis is an unbiased approach to evaluate the compound mode of action, but it is still unknown whether the analysis could be widely applicable to classify molecularly targeted anti\u2010cancer agents. Here, we comprehensively obtained and analyzed 129 transcriptomic datasets of cancer cells treated with 83 anti\u2010cancer drugs or related agents, covering most clinically used, molecularly targeted drugs alongside promising inhibitors of molecular cancer targets. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis revealed that compounds targeting similar target molecules or pathways were clustered together. These results confirmed that the gene signatures of these drugs reflected their modes of action. Of note, inhibitors of oncogenic kinase pathways formed a large unique cluster, showing that these agents affect a shared molecular pathway distinct from classical antitumor agents and other classes of agents. The gene signature analysis further classified kinome\u2010targeting agents depending on their target signaling pathways, and we identified target pathway\u2010selective signature gene sets. The gene expression analysis was also valuable in uncovering unexpected target pathways of some anticancer agents. These results indicate that comprehensive transcriptomic analysis with our database (http://scads.jfcr.or.jp/db/cs/) is a powerful strategy to validate and re\u2010evaluate the target pathways of anticancer compounds.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary solid malignant tumor of bone. Its prognosis remains poor in the substantial proportion of patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and novel therapeutic options are therefore needed. We previously established a mouse model that mimics the aggressive behavior of human OS. ELISA\u2010based screening of such mouse tumor lysates identified platelet\u2010derived growth factor\u2013BB (PDGF\u2010BB) as an abundant soluble factor, the gene for which was expressed dominantly in surrounding nonmalignant cells of the tumor whereas that for the cognate receptor (PDGFR\u03b2) was highly expressed in OS cells. PDGF\u2010BB induced activation of both MEK\u2010ERK and PI3K\u2013Akt signaling pathways and promoted survival in OS cells deprived of serum, and these effects were blocked by the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib. These actions of PDGF\u2010BB and imatinib were mostly masked in the presence of serum, however. Whereas imatinib alone did not manifest an antitumor effect in mice harboring OS tumors, combined treatment with imatinib and adriamycin exerted a synergistic antiproliferative effect on OS cells in vivo. These results suggest that treatment of OS with imatinib is effective only when cell survival is dependent on PDGF signaling or when imatinib is combined with another therapeutic intervention that renders the tumor cells susceptible to imatinib action, such as by inducing cellular stress.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Shh (Sonic Hedgehog), a ligand of Hedgehog signaling pathway, is considered as an important oncogene and an exciting potential therapeutic target in several cancers. Comprehensive understanding regulation mechanism of Shh in cancer cells is necessary to find an effective approach to selectively block its tumorigenic function. We and others previously demonstrated that NF\u2010\u03baB activation and promoter hypomethylation contributed to the overexpression of Shh. However, the relationship between transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Shh, and their roles in malignant phenotype of cancer cells are still not clearly elucidated. In the present study, our data showed that the level of Shh was higher in breast cancer tissues with positive NF\u2010\u03baB nuclear staining and promoter hypomethylation. Additionally, survival analysis revealed that Shh overexpression, but not hypomethylation and NF\u2010\u03baB nuclear staining, was a poor prognosis indicator for breast cancers. Moreover, in vitro data demonstrated that both NF\u2010\u03baB activation and hypomethylation in promoter region were positively associated with the overexpression of Shh. Mechanistically, the hypomethylation in Shh promoter could be facilitate to NF\u2010\u03baB binding to its site, and subsequently cooperate to induce transcription of Shh. Furthermore, the biological function data indicated that overexpressed Shh enhanced the self\u2010renewal capacity and migration ability of breast cancer cells, which could be augmented by promoter demethylation and NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Overall, our findings reveal multiple and cooperative mechanisms of Shh upregulation in cancer cells, and the roles of Shh in tumor malignant behavior, offering new strategy for therapeutic interventions to reduce Shh in tumors, aiming at improved prognosis.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

It is characterized by intense local skin reactions accompanied by general symptoms after mosquito bites, and infiltration of EBV\u2010infected NK cells into the bite sites. However, the mechanisms underlying these reactions have not been fully examined. We have recently described the activation of circulating basophils by mosquito extracts in vitro in a patient with HMB. To further investigate this finding, we studied four additional patients with HMB. All patients showed typical clinical features of HMB after mosquito bites and they had NK lymphocytosis and high peripheral blood EBV DNA loads. We found evidence of EBV infection in NK cells through in situ hybridization that detected EBV\u2010encoded small RNA\u20101, and flow cytometry showed HLA\u2010DR expression on almost all NK cells. Basophil activation tests with the extracts of epidemic mosquitoes Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes albopictus showed positive responses to one or both extracts in all samples from patients with HMB, suggesting the presence of mosquito antigen\u2010specific IgE and its binding to basophils. In particular, the extract of Aedes albopictus was able to activate basophils in all available patient samples. These results indicate that basophils and/or mast cells activated by mosquito bites may be involved in initiation and development of severe skin reactions to mosquito bites in HMB.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Hypoxia inducible factor\u20101\u03b1 (HIF\u20101\u03b1) is associated with human breast cancer chemoresistance. Various reports have suggested that multiple pathways are involved in HIF\u20101\u03b1 induction and that the molecular mechanisms regulating HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010induced chemoresistance is still not fully understood. Here, we report that anterior gradient 2 (AGR2), a proposed breast cancer biomarker, is an essential regulator in hypoxia\u2010induced doxorubicin resistance through the binding and stabilization of HIF\u20101\u03b1. Our results show that knockdown of AGR2 in MCF\u20107 cells leads to the suppression of HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010induced doxorubicin resistance, whereas elevated levels of AGR2 in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells enhance HIF\u20101\u03b1\u2010induced doxorubicin resistance. AGR2 expression, in turn, is up\u2010regulated by the hypoxic induction of HIF\u20101\u03b1 at both translational and transcriptional levels via a hypoxia\u2010responsive region from \u2010937 to \u2010912 bp on the AGR2 promoter sequence. By specific binding to HIF\u20101\u03b1, the increased level of intracellular AGR2 stabilizes HIF\u20101\u03b1 and delays its proteasomal degradation. Finally, we found that AGR2\u2010stabilized HIF\u20101\u03b1 escalates MDR1 mRNA levels and limits doxorubicin intake of MCF\u20107 cells, whereas MCF\u20107/ADR, a doxorubicin resistant cell line with deficient AGR2 and HIF\u20101\u03b1, acquires wild\u2010type MDR1 overexpression. Our findings, for the first time, describe AGR2 as an important regulator in chemical hypoxia\u2010induced doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, providing a possible explanation for the variable levels of chemoresistance in breast cancers and further validating AGR2 as a potential anti\u2010breast cancer therapeutic target.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Thus, tumor suppressive miRNAs and their target oncogenes have been proposed as useful targets in cancer treatment. miR\u2010200 family downregulation has been reported in cancer progression and metastasis. The miR\u2010200 family consists of two gene clusters: miR\u2010200b/200a/429 and miR\u2010200c/141, which are located on human chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively. Here, we identified that p53 response elements are located around both clusters of miR\u2010200 family and confirmed that the miR\u2010200s are transcriptional targets of p53 family. In silico analyses of miRNA targets predicted the CRKL oncogene as a potential target for miR\u2010200b/200c/429. Moreover, miR\u2010200b/200c/429 inhibited CRKL mRNA and protein expression by directly targeting its 3\u2032\u2010UTR region. Importantly, endogenous CRKL expression was decreased in cancer cells by the introduction of p53 family and endogenous p53 activation. Moreover, the downregulation of CRKL by siRNA inhibited cancer cell growth. The Oncomine database demonstrates that CRKL is overexpressed in a subset of cancer types. Furthermore, CRKL is significantly overexpressed in primary breast cancer tissues harboring mutant TP53. Our results demonstrate that the p53 target miR\u2010200b/200c/429 miRNAs are negative regulators of the CRKL oncogene.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Detecting EBV DNA load in nasopharyngeal (NP) brush/swab samples has attracted great attentions in recent years. However, its applicable value in NPC diagnosis has never been investigated in our area. It is necessary and meaningful to explore whether such test can be applicable to our local population. A total of 245 consecutive participants undergoing NP brushing examination were recruited to obtain the NP brushing samples in this study. Quantitative PCR assays were used to obtain the EBV DNA load. Mann\u2010Whitney, ANOVA and ROC test were used to analyze its diagnostic value. NP brushing samples from NPC patients showed extremely high levels of EBV DNA load (mean = 46360 copy/ng DNA) than its expression from non\u2010NPC control (mean = 28 copy/ng DNA) and high risk control (mean = 50 copy/ng DNA). It produced 96% sensitivity and 97% specificity, at the COV = 225 copy/ng DNA. Further, EBV DNA load could reflect disease progress. Our data showed a better performance of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples compared with an initial biopsy, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titers to viral capsid antigen (VCA) in serum and EBV DNA load in plasma. Detection of EBV DNA load in NP brushing samples could be used as an effective supplement for NPC's diagnosis. Due to its less invasion and low cost, NP brush sampling combined with EBV DNA detection exhibits great potential for further screening high\u2010risk populations.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

TP53 mutation, allelic deletion of the APC gene, and nuclear staining of \u03b2\u2010catenin are frequently detected in the intestinal phenotype of GC, whereas CDH1 gene mutation, microsatellite instability, and DNA hypermethylation of MLH1 are common events in the gastric phenotype of GC. Our Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) analyses revealed that CDH17, REG4, OLFM4, HOXA10, DSC2, TSPAN8, and TM9SF3 are upregulated in GC, and CLDN18 is downregulated in GC. Expression of CDH17, REG4, HOXA10, and DSC2, and downregulation of CLDN18 is observed in the intestinal phenotype of GC. In contrast, OLFM4 is expressed in the gastric phenotype of GC. Expression of TSPAN8, TM9SF3, and HER2 are not associated with either gastric or intestinal phenotypes. Ectopic CDX2 expression plays a key function in the GC intestinal phenotype. MUC2, CDH17, REG4, DSC2, and ABCB1 are direct targets of CDX2. Importantly, these genes encode transmembrane/secretory proteins, indicating that the microenvironment as well as cancer cells are also different between gastric and intestinal phenotypes of GC.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

MAS1 induces anti\u2010A\u2010II phenotypes, such as vessel dilation and depression of blood pressure. We examined the role of MAS1 in 132 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast by using immunohistochemistry. While benign mammary tissues expressed MAS1 at high levels, MAS1 expression was attenuated in all IDCs, especially in scirrhous IDCs. The decrease in MAS1 expression was associated with tumor growth, lymph node metastasis, and grade. MAS1 expression was inversely associated with the proliferation index and epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor\u20102 expression. Of the 132 cases, 12 (9.1%) were triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases. All TNBC cases (the 12 cases and the additional 36 cases using a tissue array) expressed MAS1. Using the TNBC cell lines 4T1 and MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, which expresses MAS1, we found that cell growth, anti\u2010apoptotic survival, and invasion were suppressed by MAS1 activation with A1\u20107 treatment and enhanced by MAS1 knockdown. In contrast, synergic effect was found between tamoxifen and A1\u20107 in a luminal A breast cancer cell line, MCF\u20107. Combination treatment with cisplatin, an ACE2 activator, and an A\u2010II type 1 receptor blocker showed synergic effects on tumor growth inhibition of 4T1 tumors in a syngeneic mouse model.

Lin28A and Lin28B are selective inhibitors of biogenesis of let\u20107 miRNAs involved in development and tumorigenesis. Lin28A selectively inhibits let\u20107 biogenesis through cytoplasmic uridylation of precursor let\u20107 by TUT4 terminal uridyl transferase and subsequent degradation by Dis3l2 exonuclease. On the other hand, a role of this uridylation pathway remains unclear in let\u20107 blockade by Lin28B, a paralog of Lin28A, while Lin28B is reported to engage a distinct mechanism in the nucleus to suppress let\u20107. Here we revisit a functional link between Lin28B and the uridylation pathway with a focus on let\u20107 metabolism in cancer cells. Both Lin28A and Lin28B interacted with Dis3l2 in the cytoplasm, and silencing of Dis3l2 upregulated uridylated pre\u2010let\u20107 in both Lin28A\u2010 and Lin28B\u2010expressing cancer cell lines. Additionally, we found that amounts of let\u20107 precursors influenced intracellular localization of Lin28B. Furthermore, we found that MCPIP1 (Zc3h12a) ribonuclease was also involved in degradation of both non\u2010uridylated and uridylated pre\u2010let\u20107. Cancer transcriptome analysis showed association of expression levels of Lin28B and uridylation pathway components, TUT4 and Dis3l2, in various human cancer cells and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Recently, many somatic and germline mutations of BAP1 have been reported in a broad spectrum of tumors. In this study, we identified a novel somatic non\u2010synonymous BAP1 mutation, a phenylalanine\u2010to\u2010isoleucine substitution at codon 170 (F170I), in one of 49 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESC). Multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of BAP1 gene in this ESC tumor disclosed monoallelic deletion (LOH), suggesting BAP1 alterations on both alleles in this tumor. The deubiquitinase activity and the auto\u2010deubiquitinase activity of F170I\u2010mutant BAP1 were markedly suppressed compared with wild\u2010type BAP1. In addition, wild\u2010type BAP1 mostly localizes to the nucleus, whereas the F170I mutant preferentially localized in the cytoplasm. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of the F170I mutant drastically altered gene expression profiles compared with expressed wild\u2010type BAP1. Gene\u2010ontology analyses indicated that the F170I mutation altered the expression of genes involved in oncogenic pathways. We found that one candidate, TCEAL7, previously reported as a putative tumor suppressor gene, was significantly induced by wild\u2010type BAP1 as compared to F170I mutant BAP1. Furthermore, we found that the level of BAP1 expression in the nucleus was reduced in 44% of ESCs examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Because the nuclear localization of BAP1 is important for its tumor suppressor function, BAP1 may be functionally inactivated in substantial portion of ESCs. Taken together, BAP1 is likely to function as a tumor suppressor in at least a part of ESC.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of measuring the elastic modulus (EM) in colorectal cancer tissue.

Data on the EM were compared with clinicopathological findings, including stromal features represented by Azan staining and the \u03b1\u2010SMA positive area ratio of the tumor area. Finally, a cDNA microarray profile of the tumors with high EM were compared with the findings of tumors with low EM. A higher EM in tumors was associated with pathological T\u2010, N\u2010, and M\u2010stage tumors (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.011, respectively).

The EM showed strongly positive correlation with the Azan staining positive area ratio (r = 0.908) and \u03b1\u2010SMA positive area ratio (r = 0.921). Finally, the cDNA microarray data of the tumors with high EM revealed a distinct gene expression profile compared with data from those tumors with low EM. The assessment of the elasticity of colorectal cancer tissue may allow a more accurate clinical stage or prognosis estimation. The distinct phenotypical features of the high EM tumors and their strong association with stromal features suggest the existence of a biological mechanism involved in this phenomenon that may contribute to future therapy.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in either chronically injured or seemingly intact livers. To explore the tumorigenic mechanisms underlying these different conditions, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of mouse hepatocellular tumors induced by the repeated injection of CCl4 or a single diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection using a cDNA microarray. We identified tumor\u2010associated genes that were expressed differentially in the cirrhotic CCl4 model (H19, Igf2, Cbr3, and Krt20) and the noncirrhotic DEN model (Tff3, Akr1c18, Gpc3, Afp, and Abcd2) as well as genes that were expressed comparably in both models (Ly6d, Slpi, Spink3, Scd2, and Cpe). The levels and patterns of mRNA expression of these genes were validated by RT\u2010qPCR analyses. Most of these genes were highly expressed in mouse livers during the fetal/neonatal periods. We also examined the mRNA expression of these genes in mouse tumors induced by thioacetamide, another cirrhotic inducer, and those that developed spontaneously in noncirrhotic livers and found that they shared a similar expression profile as that observed in CCl4\u2010induced and DEN\u2010induced tumors, respectively. There was a close relationship between the expression levels of Igf2 and H19 mRNA, which were activated in the cirrhotic models. Our results show that mouse liver tumors reactivate fetal/neonatal genes, some of which are specific to cirrhotic or noncirrhotic modes of pathogenesis.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism of cancer invasion and metastasis. Although p53 bingding protein 1 (53BP1) has been implicated in several biological processes, its function in EMT of human cancers has not yet been reported. Here, we demonstrated that 53BP1 negatively regulated the EMT by modulating ZEB1 through targeting miR\u2010200b and miR\u2010429. Furthermore, 53BP1 promoted ZEB1\u2010mediated up\u2010regulation of E\u2010cadherin and also inhibited the expressions of mesenchymal markers, leading to increased migration and invasion in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 breast cancer cells. Consistently, in MCF\u20107 breast cancer cells, low 53BP1 expression reduced E\u2010cadherin expression, resulting in increased migration and invasion. These effects were reversed by miR\u2010200b and miR\u2010429 inhibition or overexpression. Sections of tumor xenograft model showed increased ZEB1 expression and decreased E\u2010cadherin expression as the down\u2010regulation of 53BP1. In 18 clinical tissue samples expression of 53BP1 was positively correlated with miR\u2010200b and mir\u2010429 and negatively correlated with ZEB1. It was also found that 53BP1 was associated with the lymph node metastasis. Taken together, these results suggested that 53BP1 functioned as a tumor suppressor gene by its novel negative control of EMT through regulating the expression of miR\u2010200b/429 and their target gene ZEB1.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "We have previously reported that an adaptor protein CRK including CRK\u2010I and CRK\u2010II plays essential roles in the malignant potential of various aggressive human cancers, suggesting validity of targeting CRK in molecular targeted therapy of a wide range of cancers. Nevertheless, the role of CRK in human bladder cancer with a marked invasion, caused of distant metastasis and poor prognosis, remains obscure. In the present study, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a striking enhancement of CRK\u2010I/\u2010II, but not CRK\u2010L, in human bladder cancer tissues compared to normal urothelium. We established CRK\u2010knockdown bladder cancer cells using 5637 and UM\u2010UC\u20103, which exhibited a significant decline in cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. It is noteworthy that an elimination of CRK conferred suppressed phosphorylation of c\u2010Met and the downstream scaffold protein Gab1 in HGF\u2010dependent and \u2010independent manner. In epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT)\u2010related molecules, E\u2010cadherin was up\u2010regulated by CRK elimination, whereas N\u2010cadherin, vimentin, and Zeb1 were down\u2010regulated. Similar effect was observed by treatment with c\u2010Met inhibitor SU11274. Depletion of CRK significantly decreased cell proliferation of 5637 and UM\u2010UC\u20103, consistent with reduced activity of ERK. Orthotopic xenograft model with bioluminescent imaging was demonstrated that CRK\u2010knockdown significantly attenuated not only tumor volume but also the number of circulating tumor cells, resulted in a complete abrogation of metastasis. Taken together, these evidences uncovered essential roles of CRK in invasive bladder cancer through HGF/c\u2010Met/CRK\u2010feedback loop for EMT induction. Thus, CRK might be a potent molecular target in bladder cancer, particularly for preventing the metastasis, leading to the resolution of clinically longstanding critical issue.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

However, the factors that modulate UHRF1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Here we showed that compared with corresponding normal tissues, UHRF1 was upregulated and miR\u20109 was downregulated in CRC tissues. The expression of UHRF1 was inversely correlated with overall survival rates of patients with CRC. Overexpression of miR\u20109 in CRC cell lines significantly attenuated CRC cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis.

In this study, we verified that miR\u201034a directly and functionally targeted Notch1 in MCF\u20107 cells. We reported that miR\u201034a negatively regulated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and breast cancer stem cell propagation by downregulating Notch1. The expression of miR\u201034a was negatively correlated with tumor stages, metastasis and Notch1 expression in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of miR\u201034a increased chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (PTX) by downregulating Notch1 pathway. Mammospheres formation and expression of the stemness factor ALDH1 were also reduced in the cells treated with miR\u201034a and PTX compared to those treated with PTX alone. Taken together, our results indicate that miR\u201034a inhibited breast cancer stemness and increased the chemosensitivity to PTX partially by downregulating Notch1 pathway, suggesting that miR\u201034a/Notch1 play an important role in regulating BCSCs.

Amino acid substitution in the SIM sequence (SIM/M) within the BTB/POZ domain partially reduced K167 SUMOylation activity of NACC1.

In this study, we subjected glioma specimens to immunohistochemical and histochemical double\u2010staining methods and found that VM and HDAC3 expression were related to the pathological grade of gliomas. The presence of VM correlated with HDAC3 expression in glioma tissues. The formation of tubular structures, as determined by the tube formation assay to evaluate VM, was impaired in U87MG cells when transfected by siRNA or treated with an HDAC3 inhibitor. Importantly, the expression of VM\u2010related molecules such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)\u20102/14 and laminin, gamma 2 (Ln5\u03b32)was also affected when HDAC3 expression was altered.

The first was the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)\u2010induced inflammation\u2010associated colon carcinogenesis model and the second was the ApcMin/+ genetic cancer susceptibility model. In AOM/DSS\u2010treated mice, administration of ghrelin significantly suppressed tumor formation in the colon. In contrast, ghrelin administration did not affect the number of intestinal tumors formed in ApcMin/+ mice. The absence of endogenous ghrelin did not affect the incidence of intestinal tumors in either AOM/DSS\u2010treated mice or ApcMin/+ mice, though tumor size tended to be larger in Ghrl\u2010/\u2010 colons in the AOM/DSS model. No tumor\u2010promoting effect was observed by ghrelin administration in either tumorigenesis model. In summary, this study provides in vivo experimental evidence for the usefulness of ghrelin administration in the chemoprevention of inflammation\u2010associated colorectal carcinogenesis and may suggest its safety in patients under colitis\u2010associated cancer susceptibility conditions.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "BIRC2 and BIRC3 are closely related members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins and play pivotal roles in regulation of NF\u2010\u03baB signaling and apoptosis. Copy number loss for and somatic mutation of BIRC2 and BIRC3 have been frequently detected in lymphoid malignancies, with such genetic alterations being thought to contribute to carcinogenesis through activation of the noncanonical NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway. Here we show that BIRC2 and BIRC3 mutations are also present in a wide range of epithelial tumors and that most such nonsense or frameshift mutations confer direct transforming potential. This oncogenic function of BIRC2/3 mutants is largely independent of their ability to activate NF\u2010\u03baB signaling. Rather, all of the transforming mutants lack an intact RING finger domain, with loss of ubiquitin ligase activity being essential for transformation irrespective of NF\u2010\u03baB regulation. The serine\u2010threonine kinase NIK was found to be an important, but not exclusive, mediator of BIRC2/3\u2013driven carcinogenesis, although this function was independent of NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Our data thus suggest that, in addition to the BIRC2/3\u2013NIK\u2013NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway, BIRC2/3\u2013NIK signaling targets effectors other than NF\u2010\u03baB and thereby contributes directly to carcinogenesis. Identification of these effectors may provide a basis for the development of targeted agents for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies and other cancers with BIRC2/3 alterations.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Fasting serum adiponectin concentrations were also examined. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The association of serum adiponectin concentration with genetic variants was calculated using a multivariate linear regression model. A significantly higher ccRCC risk was associated with the rs182052 variant A allele (adjusted OR: 1.36, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.74 for AA vs. GG, P=0.013; adjusted OR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.56 for AA vs. GG+AG, P=0.019), and this positive association was more evident in overweight subjects. Fasting serum adiponectin was lower in subjects carrying A alleles of rs182052 in both ccRCC patients (\u03b2=\u20100.399, P=0.018) and healthy controls (\u03b2=\u20100.371, P=0.024).

                "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer, whether acquired or intrinsic, remains a major clinical obstacle. Thus, increasing tumor cells sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agents is helpful to improve the clinical management of breast cancer. In the present study, we found an induction of HO\u20101 expression in the doxorubicin (DOX)\u2010treated MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, which showed insensitive to DOX treatment. Knockdown HO\u20101 expression dramatically up\u2010regulated the incidence of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell death under DOX treatment, indicating that HO\u20101 functions as a critical contributor to drug resistance in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. We further observed that DOX exposure induced a cytoprotective autophagic flux in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells, which was dependent on HO\u20101 induction. Moreover, up\u2010regulation of HO\u20101 expression required the activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream regulator, protein kinase Src. Abrogating Src/STAT3 pathway activation attenuated HO\u20101 and autophagy induction, thus increasing the chemosensitivity of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Therefore, we conclude that Src/STAT3\u2010dependent HO\u20101 induction protects MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 breast cancer cells from DOX\u2010induced death via promoting autophagy. In the following study, we further demonstrated the contribution of Src/STAT3/HO\u20101/autophagy pathway activation to DOX resistance in another breast cancer cell line, MDA\u2010MB\u2010468, which bears the similar phenotype as MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Therefore, activation of Src/STAT3/HO\u20101/autophagy signaling pathway might play a general role in protecting certain subtype of breast cancer cells from DOX\u2010induced cytotoxicity. Targeting this signaling event may provide a potential approach to overcome DOX resistance in breast cancer therapeutics.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Five studies were eligible for meta\u2010analysis of mammographic screening without clinical breast examination. The relative risk for women aged 40\u201074 years was 0.75 (95%CI: 0.67\u20100.83).

In both screening methods, the number needed to invite was higher in women aged 40 years than in women aged 50\u201070 years. These results suggest that mammographic screening without clinical breast examination can afford higher benefits to women aged 50 years and over.

In this study, we found BAP1 mutations in 5 (26%) of the 19 cell lines that we established from Japanese MM patients, and examined functional differences between the wild\u2010type and mutant BAP1. First, we studied the subcellular localization of BAP1, demonstrating that the wild\u2010type primarily resides in the nucleus and that the mutant BAP1 is found in the cytoplasm of the cells. Transduction of the wild\u2010type BAP1 vector into MM cells with homozygous deletion (HD) at the BAP1 3\u2019 side resulted in both inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage\u2010independent cell growth, while BAP1 mutants of a missense or C\u2010terminal truncated form showed impaired growth inhibitory effects. Next, we studied how BAP1 is involved in MM cell survival after irradiation (IR) which causes DNA damage. After IR, we found that both wild\u2010type and mutant BAP1 were similarly phosphorylated and phospho\u2010BAP1 localized mainly in the nucleus. Interestingly, BRCA1 proteins were decreased in the MM cells with BAP1 deletion, and that transduction of the mutants as well as wild\u2010type BAP1 increased BRCA1 proteins, suggesting that BAP1 may promote DNA repair partly through stabilizing BRCA1. Furthermore, using the MM cells with BAP1 deletion, we found that the wild\u2010type, and even a missense mutant, BAP1 conferred a higher survival rate after IR compared to the control vector. Our results suggested that, while wild\u2010type BAP1 suppresses MM cell proliferation and restores cell survival after IR\u2010damage, some mutant BAP1 may also moderately retain these functions.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

CAC often acquired chemoresistance, resulting in a poorer prognosis than that of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The mechanism by which CAC enhances malignant potential remains unknown. We have previously reported that the proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) protein resulted in the non\u2010mucinous form of CRC. It also remains unknown whether Atoh1 protein is expressed in CAC. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate as to whether Atoh1 protein stabilizes in CAC. Consequently, the treatment with TNF\u2010\u03b1 stabilized Atoh1 protein by the inactivation of GSK\u20103\u03b2 via Akt, resulting in the mucinous form of CRC cell lines. Atoh1 protein also enriched cancer stem cells with upregulated Lgr5 expression and cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, resulting in both the chemo\u2010resistance to 5\u2010fluorouracil and oxaliplatin and the promotion of cell migration. Immunofluorescence of the human mucinous CAC specimens showed the accumulation of NF\u2010\u03baB p65 at nuclei with the expression of Atoh1 in mucinous cancer. In conclusion, the inflammation associated with carcinogenesis may preserve the differentiation system of IEC, resulting in the acquisition of both the mucinous phenotype and high malignant potential, including the enrichment of cancer stem cells.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "Transportation between cells and microenvironment can be divided into active, passive and vesicular types (exosomes). Exosomes are nano\u2010sized vesicles released by a variety of cells. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes play a critical role in cancers. Exosomes mediate communication between stroma and cancer cells through the transfer of nucleic acid and proteins. It is demonstrated that contents and quantity of exosomes will change after occurrence of cancers. Over the last decades, growing attention has been paid to the role of exosomes in the development of breast cancer, the most life\u2010threatening cancer in women. Breast cancer could induce salivary gland to secret specific exosomes, which could be used as biomarkers in diagnosis of early breast cancer. Exosomes\u2010delivered nucleic acid and proteins partly facilitate the tumorigenesis, metastasis and resistance of breast cancer. Exosomes could also transmit anti\u2010cancer drugs outside breast cancer cells, therefore leading to drug resistance. However, exosomes are effective tools for transportation of anti\u2010cancer drugs with lower immunogenicity and toxicity. This is a promising way to establish a drug delivery system.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Immune checkpoint molecules, which transduce co\u2010inhibitory signals to immuno\u2010competent cells, are one of the most important components conferring the immunosuppressive capacity in the tumor microenvironment. Cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocyte\u2010associated protein 4 (CTLA\u20104) and programmed cell death\u20101 (PD\u20101) are typical immune checkpoint molecules intimately involved in the suppression of anti\u2010tumor immunity.

This phase III trial was conducted with a multi\u2010center, randomized, open\u2010label, non\u2010inferiority design. Patients who received non\u2010AC MEC as an initial chemotherapy were randomly assigned to either a group administered PALO (0.75 mg, intravenously [IV]) and DEX (9.9 mg, IV) prior to chemotherapy (study treatment group), or a group administered additional DEX (8 mg, IV or orally) on days 2\u20133 (control group).

                "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor that originates from embryonic neural crest cells. The MYCN gene locus is frequently amplified in unfavorable neuroblastomas, and the gene product promotes the progression of neuroblastomas. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MYCN amplification contributes to stem cell\u2010like states of neuroblastoma remain elusive. In this study, we show that MYCN and its cis\u2010antisense gene, NCYM form a positive feedback loop with OCT4, a core regulatory gene maintaining a multipotent state of neural stem cells. We previously reported that NCYM is co\u2010amplified with the MYCN gene in primary human neuroblastomas and that the gene product promotes aggressiveness of neuroblastoma via stabilization of MYCN. In 36 MYCN\u2010amplified primary human neuroblastomas, OCT4 mRNA expression was associated with unfavorable prognosis and was correlated with that of NCYM. OCT4 induced both NCYM and MYCN in human neuroblastoma cells whereas NCYM stabilized MYCN to induce OCT4 and stem cell\u2010related genes, including NANOG, SOX2 and LIN28. In sharp contrast to MYCN, enforced expression of c\u2010MYC did not enhance OCT4 expression in human neuroblastoma cells. All\u2010trans retinoic acid treatment reduced MYCN, NCYM and OCT4 expression, accompanied by the decreased amount of OCT4 recruited onto intron 1 region of MYCN. Knockdown of NCYM or OCT4 inhibited formation of spheres of neuroblastoma cells and promoted asymmetric cell division in MYCN\u2010amplified human neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that the functional interplay between MYCN, NCYM and OCT4 contributes to aggressiveness of MYCN\u2010amplified human neuroblastomas.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

                "abstract": "It has been widely accepted that tumor cells and normal stromal cells in the host environment coordinately modulate tumor progression. Mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are the representative stress\u2010responsive cascades that exert proper cellular responses to divergent environmental stimuli. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and chemically induced tumorigenesis models have revealed that components of the MAPK pathway not only regulate the behavior of tumor cells themselves but also that of surrounding normal stromal cells in the host environment during cancer pathogenesis. The individual functions of MAPK pathway components in tumor initiation and progression vary depending on the stimuli and the stromal cell types involved in tumor progression, in addition to the molecular isoforms of the components and the origins of the tumor. Recent studies have indicated that MAPK pathway components synergize with environmental factors (e.g., tobacco smoke and diet) to affect tumor initiation and progression. Moreover, some components play distinct roles in the course of tumor progression, such as before and after the establishment of tumors. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted functions of MAPK pathway components in tumor initiation and progression is essential for the improvement of cancer therapy. In this review, we focus on the reports that utilized knockout (KO), conditional knockout (cKO) and transgenic (Tg) mice of MAPK pathway components to investigate the effects of MAPK pathway components on tumor initiation and progression in the host environment.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

To develop a novel monoclonal antibody\u2010based cancer therapy targeting APN/CD13, we established a fully humanized anti\u2010APN/CD13 monoclonal antibody, MT95\u20104. In vitro, MT95\u20104 inhibited APN/CD13 enzymatic activity on the tumor cell surface and blocked tumor cell invasion. B16 mouse melanoma cells stably expressing human APN/CD13 were also established and were subcutaneously inoculated or intravenously injected into nude mice. We found that expression of human APN/CD13 in murine melanoma cells increased the size of subcutaneous tumors, extent of lung metastasis, and degree of angiogenesis in the subcutaneous tumors; these tumor\u2010 and angiogenesis\u2010promoting characteristics were reduced by the intraperitoneal administration of MT95\u20104. To further verify the specificity of MT95\u20104 for neutralization of APN/CD13 activity, MT95\u20104 was administered into NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously inoculated with H1299 or PC14 cells, which exhibit high expression of APN/CD13, or with A549 cells, which exhibit weak expression of APN/CD13. MT95\u20104 reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice bearing H1299\u2010 and PC14\u2010derived tumors, but not in mice bearing A549\u2010derived tumors. These results suggested that the antitumor and anti\u2010angiogenic effects of MT95\u20104 were dependent on APN/CD13 expression in tumor cells. Given that MT95\u20104 is the first fully humanized monoclonal antibody against APN/CD13, MT95\u20104 should be recognized as a promising candidate for monoclonal antibody therapy against tumors expressing APN/CD13.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The miR\u2010302/367 cluster has also been shown to control self\u2010renewal and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, but there is limited, mostly correlational, information about these pluripotency\u2010related miRNAs in cancer. We evaluated whether aberrant expression of such miRNAs could affect tumor cell behavior and stem\u2010like traits, thereby contributing to aggressiveness of medulloblastoma cells. Basal expression of primary and mature forms of miR\u2010367 were detected in four human medulloblastoma cell lines and expression of the latter was found to be up\u2010regulated upon enforced expression of OCT4A. Transient overexpression of miR\u2010367 significantly enhanced tumor features typically correlated with poor prognosis, namely cell proliferation, 3D tumor spheroid cell invasion and ability to generate neurosphere\u2010like structures enriched in CD133 expressing cells. A concurrent down\u2010regulation of the miR\u2010367 cancer\u2010related targets RYR3, ITGAV and RAB23, was also detected in miR\u2010367 overexpressing cells. Overall, these findings support a pro\u2010oncogenic activity for miR\u2010367 in medulloblastoma and reveal a possible mechanism contributing to tumor aggressiveness, which could be further explored to improve patient stratification and treatment of this important type of pediatric brain cancer.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Although somatic stem cells in normal tissues are more sensitive to reprogramming induction than differentiated cells, it remains to be elucidated whether any specific subpopulations are sensitive to reprogramming in heterogeneous tumor tissues. Here we examined the susceptibility of pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non\u2010CSCs to reprogramming. To characterize CSC populations, we focused on c\u2010Met signaling, which has been identified as a marker of CSCs in mouse experiments in vivo. Cells that expressed high levels of c\u2010Met showed higher CSC properties, such as tumor\u2010initiating capacity, and resistance to gemcitabine. Real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction in cells expressing high levels of c\u2010Met revealed endogenous expression of reprogramming factors, such as OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC. Introduction of these four factors resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase staining in cells with high c\u2010Met expression than in controls. Therefore, the study results demonstrate that cellular reprogramming may be useful for extensive epigenetic modification of malignant features of pancreatic CSCs.<br>\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Conventional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have gained reasonable success. However, most of these patients experience a severe torment, both mentally and physically. Numerous studies have indicated that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), when used in conjunction with conventional allopathic therapies, can enhance their efficacy and diminish the resulting side effects and complications. Therefore, a deeper understanding of TCM is of immense help to physicians and other health care providers in providing a better care to patients. TCM is proved to be efficacious in terms of suppressing tumor progression, improving immune system function, and increasing the sensitivity to chemo- and radio-therapies. Although TCM can be delivered in various dosage forms, pills, decoctions, and injections are the three most commonly used forms in treating liver cancer. While these traditional dosage forms limits the usage of herbal medicines to their full potential novel TCM delivery forms such as nanoparticles can enhance the bioavailability, reduce any associated side effect, achieve targeted delivery, and improve the acceptance of TCM by patients. This review summarizes the current application of TCM in different prescriptions and dosage forms in the treatment of liver cancer, along with their advantages and disadvantages, all of which is believed to contribute to better understanding of Chinese herbal medicines as an essential part in the treatment of liver cancer and the importance of this trend to combine TCM and western medicine in novel dosage forms for a better management of the condition.",

Thus, DGC constitutes a poor prognosis subgroup of GC with no known promising therapies. Recent genomic characterization of GC by whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing showed that a large number of known cancer-related genes are frequently mutated in gastric malignancies. In the light of this discovery, we did an extensive review of recent literature on progress in genetic and epigenetic profile of DGC.

However, still limited data is available on the safety of administering targeted agents in pregnant cancer patients. Given the increasing use of targeted agents in clinical practice, it is becoming vital to properly understand how far they can be used in a pregnant patient without compromising the outcome of the fetus. Unlike chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies are large molecules that require active transport via the placenta to reach the fetus. On the other hand, similarly to chemotherapy, small molecules like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can cross the placenta throughout the pregnancy period. The majority of targeted agents have worrying preclinical data discouraging their use during pregnancy. Multi-TKIs are of particular concern given their potential interference with other vital physiological functions that could be necessary in fetal development. Yet this does not mean that all targeted agents should be avoided completely during pregnancy.

Recent developments based on the thermoradiobiological rationale of hyperthermia indicate it to be a potent radio- and chemosensitizer. This has been further corroborated through positive clinical outcomes in various tumor sites using thermoradiotherapy or thermoradiochemotherapy approaches. Moreover, being devoid of any additional significant toxicity, hyperthermia has been safely used with low or moderate doses of reirradiation for retreatment of previously treated and recurrent tumors, resulting in significant tumor regression. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies also indicate a unique immunomodulating prospect of hyperthermia, especially when combined with radiotherapy. In addition, the technological advances over the last decade both in hardware and software have led to potent and even safer loco-regional hyperthermia treatment delivery, thermal treatment planning, thermal dose monitoring through noninvasive thermometry and online adaptive temperature modulation. The review summarizes the outcomes from various clinical studies (both randomized and nonrandomized) where hyperthermia is used as a thermal sensitizer of radiotherapy and-/or chemotherapy in various solid tumors and presents an overview of the progresses in loco-regional hyperthermia. These recent developments, supported by positive clinical outcomes should merit hyperthermia to be incorporated in the therapeutic armamentarium as a safe and an effective addendum to the existing oncological treatment modalities. <br>\n Graphical abstract <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Mutations in KRAS exon 2 (codon 12/13) are an established predictor of lack of response to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and have been used routinely in clinical practice to identify patients unlikely to derive benefit from these therapies. However, a meaningful proportion of patients with mCRC have tumors bearing other mutations in RAS genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that evaluation of an extended panel of RAS mutations\u2014including mutations in KRAS exon 2, 3, and 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4\u2014can better define the patient population that is unlikely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapy, with concomitant improvements in outcomes in the more highly selected RAS wild-type group. This discovery has changed the practice of oncology and has the potential to spare patients from exposure to ineffective therapy. In the near future, it is important for the oncology community to validate extended RAS analysis assays and make certain that patients who are candidates for anti-EGFR therapy undergo appropriate testing and treatment. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Ngwa , Yan  Gong<br>\n<br>\n Despite the widespread use of bisphosphonates and their unequivocal efficacy for the treatment of various disease states, osteonecrosis of the jaw remains one of the most feared complications associated with their use. Current evidence, however, suggests that there is also a relationship between occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw and use of other classes of pharmacotherapies namely RANKL inhibitors as well as angiogenesis inhibitors. Although these drugs have different mechanisms of action than bisphosphonates, they all seem to interfere with the bone remodeling process i.e. alter the balance between bone resorption and bone formation which may be the most plausible explanation for pathogenesis of osteonecrosis of the jaw. The main objective of this review is to introduce the readership to a number of relatively new medications that may cause osteonecrosis of the jaw. Accordingly, we will summarize latest findings from clinical studies, meta analyses and case reports published in medical literature on this topic. For some of these medications, the evidence may not appear as robust as that for bisphosphonates; yet, the possibility of this adverse event occurring with these non bisphosphonate drugs should never be precluded unless proven otherwise. Thus, it is imperative that health care providers implement preventive measures so as to circumvent the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw. In this day of age where medical care is becoming personalized, we will highlight some of significant findings from studies seeking to identify genetic markers that may potentially play a role in development of osteonecrosis of the jaw. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

HDAC inhibitors are small molecules that directly interact with HDAC catalytic sites preventing the removal of acetyl groups, thereby counteracting the effects of HDACs. Since the first HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, was investigated as a potential antitumor agent, there have been a number of other HDAC inhibitors developed to improve efficacy and safety. Despite significant progress in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, overall survival is still poor. The discovery that HDACs may play a role in hematologic malignancies and preclinical studies showing promising activity with HDAC inhibitors in various tumor types, led to clinical evaluation of HDAC inhibitors as potential treatment options for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved two HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat (2006) and romidepsin (2009), for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This review highlights the safety of HDAC inhibitors currently approved or being investigated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, with a specific focus on the safety experience with vorinostat in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Materials and methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of time-to-event data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the three main types of lymphadenectomy (D1, D2, and D3) for gastric cancer. Hazard ratio (HR) was considered the effect measure for both overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The quality of the available evidence was assessed using the GRADE system.   Results Eight RCTs enrolling 2515 patients were eligible. The meta-analysis of four RCTs (n =1599) showed a significant impact of D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy on DSS (summary HR=0.807, CI: 0.705\u20130.924, P =0.002), the corresponding number-to-treat being equal to ten. This effect remained clinically valuable even after adjustment for postoperative mortality. However, the quality of evidence was graded as moderate due to inconsistency issues. When OS and DFS were considered, the meta-analysis of respectively five (n =1653) and three RCTs (n =1332) found no significant difference between D2 and D1 lymph node dissection (summary HR=0.911, CI: 0.708\u20131.172, P =0.471, and summary HR=0.946, CI: 0.840\u20131.066, P =0.366, respectively). However, at subgroup analysis D2 type resulted superior to D1 type lymphadenectomy in terms of OS considering the two RCTs carried out in Eastern countries (summary HR=0.627, CI: 0.396\u20130.994, P =0.047). As regards the D3 vs D2 comparison, the meta-analysis of the three available RCTs (n =862) showed no significant impact of more extended lymphadenectomy on OS (summary HR=0.990, CI: 0.814\u20131.205, P =0.924).   Conclusions Our findings support the superiority of D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy in terms of survival benefit. However, this advantage is mainly limited to DSS, the level of evidence is moderate, and the interaction with other factors affecting patient survival (such as complementary medical therapy) remains to be elucidated. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association with all available studies.   Methods Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE to April 2015. We calculated the summary hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. We estimated combined HRs associated with defined increments of statin use, using random-effects meta-analysis and dose\u2013response meta-regression models.   Results Thirty-nine cohort studies and two case-control studies involving 990,649 participants were included. The results showed that patients who used statins after diagnosis had a HR of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72\u20130.91) for all-cause mortality compared to non-users. Those who used statin after diagnosis (vs. non-users) had a HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66\u20130.88) for cancer-specific mortality. Prediagnostic exposure to statin was associated with both all-cause mortality (HR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.74\u20130.85) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.60\u20130.79). Stratifying by cancer type, the three largest cancer-type subgroups were colorectal, prostate and breast cancer and all showed a benefit from statin use. HRs per 365 defined daily doses increment were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69\u20130.92) for all-cause mortality and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67\u20130.89) for cancer-specific mortality.

Aberrant signaling by FGFs (fibroblast growth factors) and FGFRs (fibroblast growth factors receptors) has been implicated in several human cancers and, particularly, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FGFR gene amplifications, somatic missense mutations, chromosomal translocations are the most frequent mechanisms able to induce aberrant activation of this pathway. Data from literature have established that the presence of an aberrant FGFR signaling has to be considered a possible negative prognostic factor but predictive of potential sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. In the last years, clinical research efforts allowed to identify and evaluate promising FGFR inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies, ligand traps, non-selective or selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Retrospective studies have established that STAT3 expression or phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3 or activated STAT3) are poor prognostic markers for breast, colon, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer. Silibinin or silybin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid which is present in seed extracts of milk thistle (Silybum marianum). Silibinin has been shown to inhibit multiple cancer cell signaling pathways in preclinical models, demonstrating promising anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. This review summarizes evidence suggesting that silibinin can inhibit pSTAT3 in preclinical cancer models. We also discuss current strategies to overcome the limitations of oral administration of silibinin to cancer patients to translate the bench results to the bed side.

Only papers that cover radiotherapy in an oncological setting were selected and only if no concurrent cytotoxic treatment was given. Targeted immune therapy was allowed.   Results Twenty-three case reports, one retrospective study and 13 preclinical papers were selected. Eleven preclinical papers used a combination of immune modification and radiotherapy to achieve abscopal effects. Patient age range (28\u201383years) and radiation dose (median total dose 32Gy) varied. Fractionation size ranged from 1.2Gy to 26Gy. Time to documented abscopal response ranged between less than one and 24months, with a median reported time of 5months. Once an abscopal response was achieved, a median time of 13months went by before disease progression occurred or the reported follow-up ended (range 3\u201339months).   Conclusion Preclinical data points heavily toward a strong synergy between radiotherapy and immune treatments. Recent case reports already illustrate that such a systemic effect of radiotherapy is possible when enhanced by targeted immune treatments.

The combination of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (RCHOP) followed by mediastinal radiation results in a plateau in progression-free survival after first few years of follow-up. In rituximab era, a negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed after the completion of immunochemotherapy has a high predictive value for durable remission. Consequently, end-of-therapy PET may be utilizable to avoid radiation without compromising survival. Additionally, intensified chemotherapy alone has shown excellent survival. PMBCL is frequently associated with amplification of programmed death ligand (PDL) 1/2 and constitutive activation of JAK\u2013STAT and NFKB pathways; these may serve as promising therapeutic targets. Clinical trials that integrate novel therapies into upfront immunochemotherapy and utilize end-of-therapy PET scan to guide mediastinal radiation have potential to further enhance survival and prevent long-term toxicities. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The MPM incidence is 1\u20136/100,000 and is increasing as a result of historic asbestos exposure in industrialized countries and continued use of asbestos in developing countries. Lack of accurate biomarkers makes diagnosis, prognostication and treatment prediction of MPM challenging. The aim of this review is to identify the front line of MPM biomarkers with current or potential clinical impact. Literature search using the PubMed and PLoS One databases, the related-articles function of PubMed and the reference lists of associated publications until April 26th 2015 revealed a plethora of candidate biomarkers. The current gold standard of MPM diagnosis is a combination of two positive and two negative immunohistochemical markers in the epithelioid and biphasic type, but sarcomatous type do not have specific markers, making diagnosis more difficult. Mesothelin in serum and pleural fluid may serve as adjuvant diagnostic with high specificity but low sensitivity. Circulating proteomic and microRNA signatures, fibulin-3, tumor cell gene-ratio test, transcriptomic, lncRNA, glycopeptides, pleural fluid FISH assay, hyaluronate/N-ERC mesothelin and deformability cytometry may be important future markers. Putative predictive markers for pemetrexed\u2013platinum are tumor TS and TYMS, for vinorelbine the ERCC1, beta-tubuline class III and BRCA1. Mutations of the BAP1 gene are potential markers of MPM susceptibility. In conclusion, the current status of MPM biomarkers is not satisfactory but encouraging as more sensitive and specific non-invasive markers are emerging. However, prospective validation is needed before clinical application. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Since traditional treatments failed to confer a survival benefit, patients were preferentially entered into clinical trials of investigational agents. A greater understanding of the epidemiology and biology of disease has underpinned the development of newer therapies, including six agents that have been approved in the EU, US and/or Japan: a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor (ipilimumab), two programmed cell death-1 receptor inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), two BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and a MEK inhibitor (trametinib). The availability of these treatments has greatly improved the outlook for patients with advanced melanoma; however, a major consideration for physicians is now to determine how best to integrate these agents into clinical practice. Therapeutic decisions are complicated by the need to consider patient and disease characteristics, and individual treatment goals, alongside the different efficacy and safety profiles of agents with varying mechanisms of action. Long-term survival, an outcome largely out of reach with traditional systemic therapies, is now a realistic goal, creating the additional need to re-establish how clinical benefit is evaluated. In this review we summarise the current treatment landscape in advanced melanoma and discuss the promise of agents still in development. We also speculate on the future of melanoma treatment and discuss how combination and sequencing approaches may be used to optimise patient care in the future. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Vansteenkiste<br>\n<br>\n Chemotherapy is currently the standard of care for non-oncogene-driven advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to improvements in chemotherapeutic choices and supportive care, patients currently typically undergo multiple lines of chemotherapy as their disease progresses. Although treatments have improved over recent years, limited benefits are seen, especially in patients receiving later-line chemotherapy, as response rates can be low, response duration short and survival poor. Furthermore, only a small percentage of patients derive benefit from later-line therapy, with most experiencing deteriorating quality of life and significant toxicities. More recently, molecular targeted therapies have provided improvements in outcomes. However, these treatments only offer a clear benefit in subsets of tumours harbouring the appropriate genomic alteration (mutation, amplification, translocation). Most of the genomic abnormalities susceptible to therapeutic intervention are detected in adenocarcinoma, mainly in never smokers, while alterations in the genome of other histological subtypes are known but specific agents targeting these alterations have yet to be developed. Thus, the therapeutic management of these subtypes represents an ongoing challenge. Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the potential of immuno-oncology based treatments for NSCLC, offering the potential to provide durable responses and outcomes regardless of histology or mutation status. This review discusses the current unmet medical needs in NSCLC, the limits of current first-line and later-line chemotherapy and targeted agents, and the emergence of new therapeutic strategies. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

TAS-102 is an oral combination therapy consisting of trifluridine (FTD), a thymidine-based nucleoside analog, plus tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI), a novel thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor that improves the bioavailability of FTD. TAS-102 has demonstrated efficacy in 5-FU-refractory patients based on a different mechanism of action and has been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan. This review describes the mechanism of action of TAS-102, highlighting key differences between TAS-102 and 5-FU-based therapies. While both FTD and 5-FU inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS), a central enzyme in DNA synthesis, sufficient TS inhibition by FTD requires continuous infusion; therefore, it is not considered a clinically relevant mechanism with oral dosing. Instead, the primary cytotoxic mechanism with twice-daily oral dosing, the schedule used in TAS-102 clinical development, is DNA incorporation. FTD incorporation into DNA induces DNA dysfunction, including DNA strand breaks. Uracil-based analogs such as 5-FU may also be incorporated into DNA; however, they are immediately cleaved off by uracil-DNA glycosylases, reducing their ability to damage DNA. Moreover, the TPI component may enhance the durability of response to FTD. With its distinct mechanism of action and metabolism, TAS-102 is a promising treatment option for patients resistant to or intolerant of 5-FU-based fluoropyrimidines. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Although most patients with this disease have an excellent prognosis, a subset develops a more aggressive disease phenotype refractory to conventional therapies. Until recently, there was no effective therapy for these patients. With increasing knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, novel targeted therapies are being developed for this group of patients. Sorafenib and lenvatinib, small-molecule multikinase inhibitors, were approved for the treatment of progressive, symptomatic, radioactive iodine refractory, advanced differentiated thyroid cancer in 2013 and 2015, respectively. This represents a major innovation in the therapy of patients with advanced thyroid cancer. However, these therapies still have many limitations and further research needs to be pursued with the ultimate goal of providing safe and effective personalized therapy for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

These experiences may deeply affect the course and outcome of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy acceptability of antidepressants on the continuum of depressive experiences in patients suffering from cancer.   Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, as well as websites of regulatory agencies, clinical trial repositories and pharmaceutical companies, were systematically searched for published and unpublished randomised trials assessing the efficacy of antidepressants versus placebo in patients with cancer. Efficacy of antidepressants at the end of the study was the primary outcome. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014013440).   Results A total of 19 studies contributed to the analysis. Antidepressants (particularly the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and mianserin) were more effective than placebo in relieving depressive experiences in both patients with major depression or depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference \u22120.596, 95% confidence interval \u22121.041 to \u22120.150), as well as in patients with other cancer-related distressing symptoms (standardised mean difference \u22120.229, 95% confidence interval \u22120.419 to \u22120.039). We found evidence that efficacy was positively associated with length of treatment. No differences between antidepressants and placebo were found in terms of overall acceptability.   Conclusions Antidepressants should be considered as one treatment option for relieving the burden of depressive experiences in patients with cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Smit , Carmen E.  Georgescu , Romana T.  Netea-Maier<br>\n<br>\n Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. The pathogenesis of TC is complex and involves multiple genetic events that lead to activation of oncogenic pathways such as the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway has emerged as an important player in the pathogenesis of TC, particularly in follicular and advanced anaplastic or poorly differentiated TC. Because these patients have a poor prognosis, particularly when their tumors become resistant to the conventional treatment with radioactive iodine, efforts have been made to identify possible targets for therapy within these pathways. Orally available drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are being used with success in treatment of several types of malignant tumors. There is an increasing amount of preclinical and clinical data supporting that this pathway may represent a promising target for systemic therapy in TC. The present review focuses on the most recent developments on the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the pathogenesis of non-medullary TC and will provide insight into how this pathway can be targeted either alone or in the context of multimodal therapeutic strategies for treatment of advanced TC. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Hospers<br>\n<br>\n Due to differences in anatomy, primary rectal and colon cancer require different staging procedures, different neo-adjuvant treatment and different surgical approaches. For example, neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is administered solely for rectal cancer. Neodjuvant therapy and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer might be responsible in part for the differing effect of adjuvant systemic treatment on overall survival, which is more evident in colon cancer than in rectal cancer. Apart from anatomic divergences, rectal and colon cancer also differ in their embryological origin and metastatic patterns. Moreover, they harbor a different composition of drug targets, such as v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), which is preferentially mutated in proximal colon cancers, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is prevalently amplified or overexpressed in distal colorectal cancers. Despite their differences in metastatic pattern, composition of drug targets and earlier local treatment, metastatic rectal and colon cancer are, however, commonly regarded as one entity and are treated alike. In this review, we focused on rectal cancer and its biological and clinical differences and similarities relative to colon cancer. These aspects are crucial because they influence the current staging and treatment of these cancers, and might influence the design of future trials with targeted drugs. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

A modified Delphi method was used. CRCLM is defined as liver metastases detected at or before diagnosis of the primary CRC. Early and late metachronous metastases are defined as those detected \u2a7d12 months and &gt;12 months after surgery, respectively. To provide information on potential curability, use of high-quality contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) before chemotherapy is recommended. Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being used preoperatively to aid detection of subcentimetric metastases, and alongside CT in difficult situations. To evaluate operability, radiology should provide information on: nodule size and number, segmental localization and relationship with major vessels, response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, non-tumoral liver condition and anticipated remnant liver volume. Pathological evaluation should assess response to preoperative chemotherapy for both the primary tumour and metastases, and provide information on the tumour, margin size and micrometastases. Although the treatment strategy depends on the clinical scenario, the consensus was for chemotherapy before surgery in most cases. When the primary CRC is asymptomatic, liver surgery may be performed first (reverse approach). When CRCLM are unresectable, the goal of preoperative chemotherapy is to downsize tumours to allow resection. Hepatic resection should not be denied to patients with stable disease after optimal chemotherapy, provided an adequate liver remnant with inflow and outflow preservation remains. All patients with synchronous CRCLM should be evaluated by a hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In these patients, brain metastases are often the first site of progression while on TKI treatment. The TKI may however still be active on extra-cranial sites and clinicians are thus faced with the question if the TKI may be continued during cranial radiotherapy.

According to the 2004 WHO classification, 50 different histotypes were recognized. In 2013, five new distinct epithelial tumors and three provisional entities have been added to this classification, relying on morphology, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and molecular pathology advances. Targeted therapies against VEGF and mTOR pathways have become the cornerstones of the treatment for clear cell RCC, dramatically revolutionizing the patients\u2019 prognosis. Interestingly, other than mTOR and VEGF pathways, tumor proliferation of some nccRCC histotypes seems to depend on alternative signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the close correlation between papillary RCC and activation of the HGF/MET axis. Currently, several strategies are under evaluation in patients with nccRCC. These approaches include TKIs and mTOR inhibitors, MET-pathway antagonists and immunotherapy.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1, 2, 3) predominantly regulate the adaptation to hypoxia at the cellular or organismal level. HIF-2 is one of the three known alpha subunits of HIF transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that HIF-1 is associated with chemotherapy failure. Accumulating evidence in recent years suggests that HIF-2 also contributes to chemo/radioresistance in solid tumors. Despite sharing similar structures, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 had highly divergent and even opposing roles in solid tumors under hypoxic conditions. Recent studies have also implied that HIF-2\u03b1 had a role in chemo/radioresistance through different mechanisms, at least partly, compared to HIF-1\u03b1.

CUP may either resemble a specific primary tumor site sharing common clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis, or present as a distinct disease entity with undifferentiated pathological features, usually bearing dismal prognosis. Diagnosis and management have traditionally been based on clinicopathological characteristics and therapeutic strategies have been mainly empirical. In the last decade, the advent of massive gene sequencing and the advances in genomic technologies have shed light on the genomic landscape of CUP. Several gene panel tests are currently commercially available and are used in an effort to correlate the genomic characteristics of a specific CUP tumor to those of a known primary tumor, guiding thus therapeutic management. Nevertheless, these efforts are hampered by the rarity of CUP and the inability to validate the results of such tests due to the paucity of randomized clinical trials. In the current work, we provide an overview of CUP with emphasis on the impact of the genome sequencing technologies on diagnosis and management of these tumors. We also discuss potential implications of genomics for the future treatment of CUP and address the challenges of the implementation of these therapeutic strategies in routine clinical practice. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Because of the large inter-individual variability (IIV) in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel, it is challenging to determine the optimal dose in individual patients in order to achieve optimal efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Despite the established correlation between systemic docetaxel exposure and efficacy, the precise factors influencing docetaxel PK are not yet completely understood. This review article highlights currently known factors that influence docetaxel PK, and focusses on those that are clinically relevant. For example, liver impairment should be taken into account when calculating docetaxel dosages as this may decrease docetaxel clearance. In addition, drug\u2013drug interactions may be of distinct clinical importance when using docetaxel. Particularly, drugs strongly inhibiting CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole should not be concurrently administered without dose modification, as they may decrease the clearance of docetaxel. Gender, castration status, and menopausal status might be of importance as potential factors influencing docetaxel PK. The role of pharmacogenetics in predicting docetaxel PK is still limited, since no polymorphisms of clinical importance have yet been established. <br>\n Graphical abstract <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Actionable driver mutations as therapeutic targets are rare. Subtype specific data concerning regulatory mechanisms or epigenetic aberrations are necessary for novel clinical trials. Although the p53 protein itself is rarely mutated in GEP-NENs, epigenetic and regulatory aberrations interfere with the p53 network activity and might function as s target for novel therapeutic approaches. In this review we analyze the current knowledge about the p53 network in GEP-NENs and discuss three possible strategies that include recovering p53 function, enforcing apoptosis by genotoxic stress induction and restoring silenced gene function, based on in vitro, in vivo and clinical data. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Hassan , John  Stagg , Walid  Mourad<br>\n<br>\n Many factors and molecules have been investigated as potential players in the pathogenesis or immunosurveillance of cancer. Among these, CD154 has been recognized as a co-stimulatory molecule with high potential for treating cancer, in addition to its contribution in the development of the disease. CD154 was initially described for its pivotal role in T cell-dependent humoral responses via an interaction with its classical receptor, CD40. Subsequent studies showed that CD154 is also implicated in cell-mediated immunity and inflammation via an interaction with CD40 alone or in combination with newly identified receptors, members of the integrin family, leading to the development of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In the current article, we present an overview of the role of CD154 as a potential etiological factor in tumors inducing proliferation of malignant cells, their rescue from apoptosis and their invasiveness. In addition, this review describes the immuno-regulatory functions of CD154 against cancer reflected by its stimulation of antigen-presenting cells and the subsequent activation of effector cells, its enhancement of malignant cells\u2019 immunogenicity, its modulation of immune settings around tumors, and its initiation of proliferation inhibiting effects in malignant cells. In vitro as well as in vivo studies are outlined and a particular attention is given to clinical studies and progress reached at this point. Findings reviewed herein will improve our knowledge of the role of the CD154 system in cancers from causative to immunotherapeutic functions, paving the way for the identification of new targets for prevention and/or treatment of malignant disorders. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The number of drugs in this class is rapidly growing, with twenty current approvals by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drugs are, however, generally characterized by a poor oral, and thus variable, bioavailability. This results in significant variation in plasma levels and exposure. The cause is a complex interplay of factors, including poor aqueous solubility, issued permeability, membrane transport and enzymatic metabolism. Additionally, food and drug\u2013drug interactions can play a significant role. The issues related with an impaired bioavailability generally receive little attention.

The implementation of high-throughput sequencing analysis and genomic technologies has led to the identification of novel molecular events that characterize NSCLC transformation and may represent critical oncogenic drivers amenable to targeted therapy. Among these, the presence of activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and of chromosomic rearrangements in the anaplastic-lymphoma kinase (ALK) proto-oncogene, have been the first well characterized genetic alterations with corresponding targeted agents to enter the clinical arena. Nevertheless, in the recent years a number of other oncogenic drivers beyond EGFR and ALK inhibition have emerged as novel molecular targets with potential therapeutic implications, including mutations in the genes KRAS, BRAF, HER2, PI3KCA and DDR2, as well as ROS1 and RET rearrangements and MET, HER2 and FGFR1 gene amplifications. The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive information on the novel therapeutic targets identified by recent preclinical evidence and to discuss developments in molecular treatments targeting these oncogenic drivers or actionable mutations beyond EGFR and ALK in advanced NSCLC. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Castration-resistant prostate cancer is an incurable and highly aggressive terminal stage of prostate cancer, seriously jeopardizing the patient\u2019s quality of life and lifespan. The management of castration-resistant prostate cancer is complex and has opened new fields of research during the last decade leading to an improved understanding of the biology of the disease and the development of new therapies. Most advanced tumors resistant to therapy still maintain the androgen receptor-pathway, which plays a central role for survival and growth of most castration-resistant prostate cancers. Many mechanisms induce the emergence of the castration resistant phenotype through this pathway. However some non-related AR pathways like neuroendocrine cells or overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Hsp27 are described to be involved in CRPC progression. More recently, loss of expression of tumor suppressor gene, post-transcriptional modification using miRNA, epigenetic alterations, alternatif splicing and gene fusion became also hallmarks of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This review presents an up-to-date overview of the androgen receptor-related mechanisms as well as the latest evidence of the non-AR-related mechanisms underlying castration-resistant prostate cancer progression. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Background Pancreaticoduodenectomy with extended lymphadenectomy fails to prolong patient survival.   Methods Prospective randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials (RCTs and NRCTs), meta-analyses, retrospective reviews, consensus conferences and pre- and intraoperative diagnoses of lymph node (LN) metastases were retrieved. Standard and extended lymphadenectomies were reviewed, including their effects on postoperative complications, mortality rate and long-term survival. The minimum total number of LN examined (TNLE) for adequate tumor staging, and the incidence of metastasis to each LN station were also considered. A pros and cons analysis was performed on the removal of each LN station.   Results Eleven retrospective studies (2514 patients), five prospective NRCTs (545 patients), and five prospective RCTs (586 patients) described different lymphadenectomies, which obtained similar long-term results. Five meta-analyses showed they did not influence long-term survival. However, N status is an important component of tumor staging. The recommended minimum TNLE is 15. The percent incidence of metastasis to each LN station was calculated considering at least 385 and up to 3725 patients. Preoperative imaging and intraoperative exploration frequently fail to identify metastatic nodes. A pros and cons analysis suggests that lymph node status is better established removing the following LN stations: 6, 8a-p, 12a-b-c, 13a-b, 14a-b-c-d, 16b1, 17a-b. Metastasis to 16b1 LNs significantly worsens prognosis. Their removal and frozen section examination, before proceeding with resection, may contraindicate resection.   Conclusion A standard lymphadenectomy demands an adequate TNLE and removal of the LN stations metastasizing more frequently, without increasing the surgical risk. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In this review, we focus on early clinical and translational research that identified multiple molecular targets, including IGF-1R; mTOR; tyrosine kinase inhibitors; EWS-FLI1-related targets, and others. Overall, novel targeted therapies demonstrated modest efficacy; however pronounced and durable antineoplastic responses have been observed in small subsets of treated patients, for example with IGF-1R antibodies. Identifying outcome-predicting biomarkers and overcoming treatment resistance remain major challenges.

Little is currently known, however, about the landscape of prospective \u201cprecision cancer medicine\u201d clinical trials in the U.S.   Methods We identified all adult interventional cancer trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between September 2005 and May 2013. Trials were classified as \u201cprecision cancer medicine\u201d if a genomic alteration in a predefined set of 88 genes was required for enrollment. Baseline characteristics were ascertained for each trial.   Results Of the initial 18,797 trials identified, 9094 (48%) were eligible for inclusion: 684 (8%) were classified as precision cancer medicine trials and 8410 (92%) were non-precision cancer medicine trials. Compared with non-precision cancer medicine trials, precision cancer medicine trials were significantly more likely to be phase II [RR 1.19 (1.10\u20131.29), p &lt;0.001], multi-center [RR 1.18 (1.11\u20131.26), p &lt;0.001], open-label [RR 1.04 (1.02\u20131.07), p =0.005] and involve breast [RR 4.03 (3.49\u20134.52), p &lt;0.001], colorectal [RR 1.62 (1.22\u20132.14), p =0.002] and skin [RR 1.98 (1.55\u20132.54), p &lt;0.001] cancers.

Next-generation sequencing studies have led to significant advances in our understanding of genomic alterations in prostate cancer. The most common genomic aberrations in this malignancy are the transcription factor fusion of TMPRSS2-ETS, and mutations in TP53, AR, RB1 and PTEN/PIK3CA. Some of these alterations are actionable by drugs available in the clinic. In addition, it was recently shown that aberrations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA2 and ATM, are present in both somatic and germline form in a significant minority of prostate cancer; these abnormalities can be targeted by drugs such as platinums and PARP inhibitors. In the era of tumour profiling, targeting molecular alterations may provide an opportunity for new therapeutic approaches. Although there are promising new agents to attack a variety of genomic signal abnormalities, biomarker-matched therapy (other than for androgens) have been utilized in only 2.0 % of clinical trials (Sept 2011 through September 2014; https://clinicaltrials.gov) for prostate cancer.

In the premetastatic phase, the permeability of pulmonary vasculatures is increased to accelerate the extravasation of circulating tumor cells. However, it is not clear whether local miRNAs contribute to the vascular hyperpermeability of the premetastatic niche.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: The expression of total miRNAs was determined using microarray in series of premetastatic lungs from tumor-bearing mice. Significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified and validated with qRT-PCR. Vascular permeability assays, vascular mimic systems, and orthotopic tumor models were used to investigate roles of selected miRNAs and target genes in premetastatic hyperpermeability.<br>\n<br>\nResults: We identified a miRNA signature in premetastatic lungs. Among these miRNAs, miR-30a, b, c, d, and e were significantly attenuated. Subsequent investigations elucidated that lung fibroblast&ndash;derived miR-30s stabilized pulmonary vessels.

Combining the three-gene panel with sPSA further improved the predictive accuracy (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75&ndash;0.86). The accuracy of the three-gene predictive model was maintained in subgroups with low sPSA concentrations.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: The urinary three-gene panel (HOXC6, TDRD1, and DLX1) represents a promising tool to identify patients with aggressive prostate cancer, also in those with low sPSA values. The combination of the urinary three-gene panel with sPSA bears great potential for the early diagnosis of patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.

                "abstract": "Purpose: The IL11 receptor (IL11R) is an established molecular target in primary tumors of bone, such as osteosarcoma, and in secondary bone metastases from solid tumors, such as prostate cancer. However, its potential role in management of hematopoietic malignancies has not yet been determined. Here, we evaluated the IL11R as a candidate therapeutic target in human leukemia and lymphoma.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design and Results: First, we show that the IL11R protein is expressed in a variety of human leukemia&ndash; and lymphoma&ndash;derived cell lines and in a large panel of bone marrow samples from leukemia and lymphoma patients, whereas expression is absent from nonmalignant control bone marrow. Moreover, a targeted peptidomimetic prototype (termed BMTP-11), specifically bound to leukemia and lymphoma cell membranes, induced ligand&ndash;receptor internalization mediated by the IL11R, and resulted in a specific dose-dependent cell death induction in these cells. Finally, a pilot drug lead-optimization program yielded a new myristoylated BMTP-11 analogue with an apparent improved antileukemia cell profile.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: These results indicate (i) that the IL11R is a suitable cell surface target for ligand-directed applications in human leukemia and lymphoma and (ii) that BMTP-11 and its derivatives have translational potential against this group of malignant diseases.

Drugs blocking PD-L1 or its receptor have shown unprecedented activity in melanoma, and our purpose was to characterize tumor PD-L1 expression and associated T-cell infiltration in metastatic melanomas.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: We used a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of two cores from 95 metastatic melanomas characterized for clinical stage, outcome, and anatomic site of disease. We assessed PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content (total T cells and CD4/CD8 subsets) by quantitative immunofluorescence.<br>\n<br>\nResults: High PD-L1 expression was associated with improved survival (P = 0.02) and higher T-cell content (P = 0.0005). Higher T-cell content (total and CD8 cells) was independently associated with improved overall survival; PD-L1 expression was not independently prognostic. High TIL content in extracerebral metastases was associated with increased time to developing brain metastases (P = 0.03). Cerebral and dermal metastases had slightly lower PD-L1 expression than other sites, not statistically significant. Cerebral metastases had less T cells (P = 0.01).<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: T-cell&ndash;infiltrated melanomas, particularly those with high CD8 T-cell content, are more likely to be associated with PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, an improved prognosis, and increased time to development of brain metastases. Studies of T-cell content and subsets should be incorporated into trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to determine their predictive value. Furthermore, additional studies of anatomic sites with less PD-L1 expression and T-cell infiltrate are needed to determine if discordant responses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are seen at those sites.

The International Prognostic Index (IPI) and the prognostic index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PIT) have limited predictive value for outcome of EATL. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model for EATL, which can identify high-risk patients who need more aggressive therapy.\n\nExperimental Design: This retrospective multicenter study was based on 92 patients and included 45 patients diagnosed with EATL between 1999 and 2009 from the Netherlands and 47 patients from England and Scotland, diagnosed with EATL between 1994 and 1998. A new EATL prognostic index (EPI) was constructed using the RPART (recursive partitioning and regression trees) procedure. Validation was performed applying the bootstrap method.\n\nResults: Three risk groups were distinguished (P < 0.0001): a high-risk group, characterized by the presence of B-symptoms [median overall survival (OS) of 2 months]; an intermediate-risk group, comprising patients without B-symptoms and an IPI score &ge; 2 (7 months); and a low-risk group, representing patients without B-symptoms and an IPI score of 0 to 1 (34 months). Internal validation showed stability of statistical significance and prognostic discrimination. In contrast with the IPI and PIT, the EPI better classified patients in risk groups according to their clinical outcome.\n\nConclusions: Our new, validated, prognostic model EPI accurately predicts survival outcome in EATL and may be used for patient selection for new therapeutic strategies and evaluation of clinical trials.

                "abstract": "Purpose: It is increasingly relevant to better define what constitutes an adequate surgical margin in an effort to improve reconstructive longevity and functional outcomes following osteosarcoma surgery. In addition, nonunion remains a challenging problem in some patients following allograft reconstruction. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) could enhance osseous union, but has been historically avoided due to concerns that it may promote tumor recurrence.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: An orthotopic xenograft murine model was utilized to describe the natural temporal course of osteosarcoma growth. Tumors were treated either with surgery alone, surgery and single-agent chemotherapy, or surgery and dual-agent chemotherapy to assess the relationship between surgical margin and local recurrence. The effect of BMP-2 on local recurrence was similarly assessed.<br>\n<br>\nResults: Osteosarcoma tumor growth was categorized into reproducible phases. Margins greater than 997 &mu;m resulted in local control following surgery alone. Margins greater than 36 &mu;m resulted in local control following surgery and single-agent chemotherapy. Margins greater than 12 &mu;m resulted in local control following surgery and dual-agent chemotherapy. The application of exogenous BMP-2 does not confer an increased risk of local recurrence.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: This model reliably reproduces the clinical, radiographic, and surgical conditions encountered in human osteosarcoma. It successfully incorporates relevant chemotherapy, further paralleling the human experience. Surgical margins required to achieve local control in osteosarcoma can be reduced using single-agent chemotherapy and further decreased using dual-agent chemotherapy.

TH-302 selectively targets hypoxic tumor regions, where it is converted into a cytotoxic agent. This study assessed the efficacy of the combination treatment of TH-302 and radiotherapy in two preclinical tumor models. The effect of oxygen modification on the combination treatment was evaluated and the effect of TH-302 on the hypoxic fraction (HF) was monitored using [18F]HX4-PET imaging and pimonidazole IHC stainings.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: Rhabdomyosarcoma R1 and H460 NSCLC tumor-bearing animals were treated with TH-302 and radiotherapy (8 Gy, single dose). The tumor oxygenation status was altered by exposing animals to carbogen (95% oxygen) and nicotinamide, 21% or 7% oxygen breathing during the course of the treatment. Tumor growth and treatment toxicity were monitored until the tumor reached four times its start volume (T4xSV).<br>\n<br>\nResults: Both tumor models showed a growth delay after TH-302 treatment, which further increased when combined with radiotherapy (enhancement ratio rhabdomyosarcoma 1.23; H460 1.49). TH-302 decreases the HF in both models, consistent with its hypoxia-targeting mechanism of action. Treatment efficacy was dependent on tumor oxygenation; increasing the tumor oxygen status abolished the effect of TH-302, whereas enhancing the HF enlarged TH-302's therapeutic effect. An association was observed in rhabdomyosarcoma tumors between the pretreatment HF as measured by [18F]HX4-PET imaging and the T4xSV.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: The combination of TH-302 and radiotherapy is promising and warrants clinical testing, preferably guided by the companion biomarker [18F]HX4 hypoxia PET imaging for patient selection.

Over the past decade, the so-called immune checkpoint inhibitors, generally monoclonal antibodies that target key regulators of T-cell activation, emerged as the most effective immune-targeted agents. Pembrolizumab is the first anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. With responses seen in 25% to 40% of patients, depending on dose and setting (i.e., before or after ipilimumab), pembrolizumab specifically and anti&ndash;PD-1 antibodies generally are revolutionizing the treatment of melanoma. However, in the setting of other recent advances in the field, a number of practical issues are emerging that need to be addressed to optimize the care of patients with melanoma. First, the optimal sequencing of therapy (first-line immunotherapy over molecular targeted therapy, ipilimumab versus pembrolizumab as initial immune checkpoint inhibitor) is unknown and must be evaluated through randomized trials. Second, there is a strong rationale to combine immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., anti&ndash;PD-1 with ipilimumab) and to combine immune therapies with targeted therapy agents, so determining whether combination therapy is better than direct sequencing is another critical issue that needs to be addressed in carefully carried out studies.

We aimed to develop an off-the-shelf whole-cell vaccine to boost CAR-redirected virus-specific CTLs in vivo after adoptive transfer. As proof of principle, we validated our vaccine approach by boosting CMV-specific CTLs (CMV-CTLs) engineered with a CAR that targets the GD2 antigen.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: We generated the whole-cell vaccine by engineering the K562 cell line to express the CMV-pp65 protein and the immune stimulatory molecules CD40L and OX40L. Single-cell&ndash;derived clones were used to stimulate CMV-CTLs in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. We also assessed whether the in vivo boosting of CAR-redirected CMV-CTLs with the whole-cell vaccine enhances the antitumor responses. Finally, we addressed potential safety concerns by including the inducible safety switch caspase9 (iC9) gene in the whole-cell vaccine.<br>\n<br>\nResults: We found that K562-expressing CMV-pp65, CD40L, and OX40L effectively stimulate CMV-specific responses in vitro by promoting antigen cross-presentation to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Vaccination also enhances antitumor effects of CAR-redirected CMV-CTLs in xenograft tumor models. Activation of the iC9 gene successfully induces growth arrest of engineered K562 implanted in mice.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: Vaccination with a whole-cell vaccine obtained from K562 engineered to express CMV-pp65, CD40L, OX40L and iC9 can safely enhance the antitumor effects of CAR-redirected CMV-CTLs.

                "abstract": "Purpose: Keratin 19 (K19) is a known marker of poor prognosis and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the relationship between K19 and cancer stem cells (CSCs) is unclear. Here, we determined whether K19 can be used as a new CSC marker and therapeutic target in HCC.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: HCC cell lines were transfected with a K19 promoter&ndash;driven enhanced green fluorescence protein gene. CSC characteristics, epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT), and TGFb/Smad signaling were examined in FACS-isolated K19+/K19&ndash; cells. K19 and TGFb receptor 1 (TGFbR1) expression in 166 consecutive human HCC surgical specimens was examined immunohistochemically.<br>\n<br>\nResults: FACS-isolated single K19+ cells showed self-renewal and differentiation into K19&ndash; cells, whereas single K19&ndash; cells did not produce K19+ cells. K19+ cells displayed high proliferation capacity and 5-fluorouracil resistance in vitro. Xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice revealed that K19+ cells reproduced, differentiated into K19&ndash; cells, and generated large tumors at a high frequency in vivo. K19+ cells were found to be involved in EMT and the activation of TGFb/Smad signaling, and these properties were suppressed by K19 knockdown or treatment with a TGFbR1 inhibitor. The TGFbR1 inhibitor also showed high therapeutic effect against K19+ tumor in the mouse xenograft model. Immunohistochemistry of HCC specimens showed that compared with K19&ndash; patients, K19+ patients had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival and higher tumor TGFbR1 expression.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: K19 is a new CSC marker associated with EMT and TGFb/Smad signaling, and it would thus be a good therapeutic target for TGFbR1 inhibition.

                "abstract": "Purpose: Up to one third of ovarian cancer patients are intrinsically resistant to platinum-based treatment. However, predictive and therapeutic strategies are lacking due to a poor understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to identify key molecular characteristics that are associated with primary chemoresistance in epithelial ovarian cancers.<br>\n<br>\nExperimental Design: Gene expression profiling was performed on a discovery set of 85 ovarian tumors with clinically well-defined response to chemotherapies as well as on an independent validation dataset containing 138 ovarian patients from the chemotreatment arm of the ICON7 trial.<br>\n<br>\nResults: We identified a distinct \"reactive stroma\" gene signature that is specifically associated with primary chemoresistant tumors and was further upregulated in posttreatment recurrent tumors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) analyses on three of the highest-ranked signature genes (POSTN, LOX, and FAP) confirmed that modulation of the reactive stroma signature genes within the peritumoral stromal compartments was specifically associated with the clinical chemoresistance. Consistent with these findings, chemosensitive ovarian cells grown in the presence of recombinant POSTN promoted resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment in vitro. Finally, we validated the reactive stroma signature in an independent dataset and demonstrated that a high POSTN expression level predicts shorter progression-free survival following first-line chemotherapy.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the important interplay between cancer and the tumor microenvironment in ovarian cancer biology and treatment. The identified reactive stromal components in this study provide a molecular basis to the further development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

                "abstract": "Purpose: Not all breast cancers respond to lapatinib. A change in Ki67 after short-term exposure may elucidate a biomarker profile for responsive versus nonresponsive tumors.\n\nExperimental Design: Women with primary breast cancer were randomized (3:1) to 10 to 14 days of preoperative lapatinib or placebo in a multicenter phase II trial (ISRCTN68509377). Biopsies pre-/posttreatment were analyzed for Ki67, apoptosis, HER2, EGFR, ER, PgR, pAKT, pERK, and stathmin by IHC. Further markers were measured by RT-PCR. Primary endpoint was change in Ki67. HER2+ was defined as 2+/3+ by IHC and FISH+.\n\nResults: One hundred twenty-one patients (lapatinib, 94; placebo, 27) were randomized; of these, 21% were HER2+, 78% were HER2&ndash; nonamplified, 26% were EGFR+. Paired samples containing tumor were obtained for 98% (118 of 121). Ki67 fell significantly with lapatinib (&ndash;31%; P < 0.001), but not with placebo (&ndash;3%). Whereas Ki67 reduction with lapatinib was greatest in HER2+ breast cancer (&ndash;46%; P = 0.003), there was a significant Ki67 decrease in HER2&ndash; breast cancer (&ndash;27%; P = 0.017) with 14% of HER2&ndash; breast cancer demonstrating &ge;50% Ki67 reduction with lapatinib. Among HER2+ patients, the only biomarker predictive of Ki67 response was the EGFR/HER4 ligand epiregulin (EREG) (rho = &ndash;0.7; P = 0.002). Among HER2&ndash; tumors, only HER3 mRNA levels were significantly associated with Ki67 response on multivariate analysis (P = 0.01). In HER2&ndash; breast cancer, HER2 and HER3 mRNA levels were highly correlated (rho = 0.67, P < 0.001), with all Ki67 responders having elevated HER3 and HER2 expression.\n\nConclusions: Lapatinib has antiproliferative effects in a subgroup of HER2&ndash; nonamplified tumors characterized by high HER3 expression. The possible role of high HER2:HER3 heterodimers in predicting response to lapatinib merits investigation in HER2&ndash; tumors.

                "abstract": "Tumors consist of a heterogeneous mixture of functionally distinct cancer cells. These functional differences can be caused by varying levels of receptor activity, differentiation, and distinct metabolic and epigenetic states. Intratumoral heterogeneity can lead to interdependence among different subpopulations of cells for sustained tumor growth. In addition, subpopulations can vary widely in their responses to therapeutic agents. As such, it is believed that intratumoral heterogeneity may underlie incomplete treatment responses, acquired and innate resistance, and disease relapse observed in the clinic in response to conventional chemotherapy and targeted agents.

The DAFNE (Dual blockade with AFatinib and trastuzumab as NEoadjuvant treatment) phase II study (NCT015591477) investigated a dual blockade with the irreversible pan-HER inhibitor afatinib and trastuzumab in this setting.\n\nExperimental Design: Participants with untreated, centrally HER2-positive breast cancer were treated for 6 weeks with afatinib (20 mg/d) and trastuzumab [(8) 6 mg/kg/3 weeks] alone; followed by 12-week treatment with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2/1 week), trastuzumab, and afatinib; followed by 12 weeks with epirubicin (90 mg/m2/3 weeks), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2/3 weeks), and trastuzumab before surgery. Primary objective was pCR rate, defined as ypT0/is ypN0. We expected a pCR rate of 70%; 65 patients were needed to exclude a rate of &le;55%.\n\nResults: pCR rate was 49.2% [90% confidence interval (CI), 38.5&ndash;60.1] in 65 treated patients. Patients with hormone receptor&ndash;negative (N = 19) or hormone receptor&ndash;positive (N = 46) tumors showed pCR rates of 63.2% and 43.5%, respectively (P = 0.153). Patients with (N = 9) or without (N = 56) lymphocyte predominant breast cancer (LPBC) showed pCR rates of 100% and 41.1%, respectively (P < 0.001). PCR rate was not different in patients with or without PIK3CA tumor mutations (P = 0.363). Clinical responses were seen in 96.3% of 54 evaluable patients, and breast conserving surgery was possible in 59.4% of 62 assessable patients. Most frequent nonhematologic grade 3&ndash;4 toxicities were diarrhea (7.7%), increased creatinine (4.6%), and infection (4.6%). One patient developed symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nConclusions: Neoadjuvant treatment with afatinib, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy showed acceptable tolerability, and a pCR rate comparable with that of other anti-HER2 doublets but below challenging expectations.

                "abstract": "The many improvements in breast cancer therapy in recent years have so lowered rates of recurrence that it is now difficult or impossible to conduct adequately powered adjuvant clinical trials. Given the many new drugs and potential synergistic combinations, the neoadjuvant approach has been used to test benefit of drug combinations in clinical trials of primary breast cancer. A recent FDA-led meta-analysis showed that pathologic complete response (pCR) predicts disease-free survival (DFS) within patients who have specific breast cancer subtypes. This meta-analysis motivated the FDA's draft guidance for using pCR as a surrogate endpoint in accelerated drug approval. Using pCR as a registration endpoint was challenged at ASCO 2014 Annual Meeting with the presentation of ALTTO, an adjuvant trial in HER2-positive breast cancer that showed a nonsignificant reduction in DFS hazard rate for adding lapatinib, a HER-family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This conclusion seemed to be inconsistent with the results of NeoALTTO, a neoadjuvant trial that found a statistical improvement in pCR rate for the identical lapatinib-containing regimen. We address differences in the two trials that may account for discordant conclusions. However, we use the FDA meta-analysis to show that there is no discordance at all between the observed pCR difference in NeoALTTO and the observed HR in ALTTO. This underscores the importance of appropriately modeling the two endpoints when designing clinical trials. The I-SPY 2/3 neoadjuvant trials exemplify this approach.

Anatomic pathology (or perhaps more aptly named \u201cdiagnostic tissue pathology\u201d) and molecular laboratory workflows are detailed herein. This section provides practitioners with a working understanding of how molecular tests are ordered and processed, and how these processes are integrated to deliver precision medicine in a timely manner. A basic understanding of pathology laboratory workflows is essential to monitor turn-around times and determine realistic timetables for receipt of actionable results. This section also details the necessary quality control (QC) steps that occur for molecular diagnostic testing. The importance of clinical interaction during the synthesis of molecular testing reports is also discussed as well as some of the informatics tools available for analysis of molecular data. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In contrast to the majority of BCC cases, cSCC accounts for significant morbidity and mortality, representing the majority of metastases and deaths related to NMSC. Several cSCC types are described with a distinct group of cSCC high-risk variants being associated with significantly elevated risk of local recurrence, metastases and death. Therefore, it is important to be able to recognize the different types of CSCC to target treatment accordingly in face of the possible more aggressive outcome of any given variant. In this work we revisit the epidemiological, clinical and histopathologic features of the main cSCC types with an effort to distinguish the different groups with divergent clinical behaviors. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Zager<br>\n<br>\n Abstract Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) are two rare dermal sarcomas that are locally aggressive but rarely metastasize. Both entities carry a very good long term prognosis. Our current approach to LMS and DFSP is multidisciplinary with the pathologist\u2019s contribution just as important the surgeon\u2019s contribution. Surgical resection is the standard of care and primary management for both DFSP and LMS. In areas approximating critical or sensitive structures (i.e., face) there is an important role for Mohs micrographic surgery. We recommend radical resection of DFSP and LMS with 1-2cm radial margins and inclusion of the subcutaneous tissue as well as the deep fascia for all lesions. While high quality data is limited regarding the benefits and role of radiation therapy in patients with DFSP or LMS, there appears to be a role for its use in large lesions or lesions with aggressive histopathologic characteristics such as fibrosarcomatous transformation in DFSP or high grade LMS. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Consequentially, it is of vital importance to be acquainted with the different facets of BCC, including its epidemiology, to the varied clinical presentations with their corresponding histological subtypes to the latest advances underlying the molecular mechanisms driving the development of this neoplasm. BCC is primarily a locally aggressive neoplasm with rare metastatic potential. Advanced cases usually represent a product of neglect and solely long-term treatment by surgical modalities. Recently, there has been an explosion of knowledge implicating the Hedgehog molecular pathway in BCC pathogenesis. This body of knowledge has led to the development of novel targeted therapies providing new alternatives for advanced and inoperable cases. In this work, we undergo a systematic, comprehensive review and update of this entity with detailed discussion of epidemiology, clinical and histopathological features and the latest molecular findings with their concomitant new therapeutic implications. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Muneer<br>\n<br>\n Penile cancer is a rare disease in Europe and North America but represents a significant global health problem due to the devastating consequences of treatment and the mortality associated with metastatic disease. The most important prognostic factor is the presence of inguinal lymph node metastases. Surgical resection of inguinal lymph nodes is the only method of accurately and reliably determining lymph node status. However, in the 75-80% of cases where no metastases are found patients have undergone extensive surgery with no survival benefit. This review evaluates the use of molecular biomarkers to predict lymph node status as well as prognosis in penile carcinoma. It will also discuss the next generation of biomarkers, which have the potential to change the diagnostic landscape in penile cancer. Evidence is emerging that panels of biomarkers may be necessary in order to achieve the high sensitivity and specificity required in clinical practice. Next generation sequencing methods may enable large numbers of biomarkers to be evaluated and combined to improve upon the existing biomarkers based on oncological pathways. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Patients and methods In this randomised multicentre prospective dose-selection phase IIb superiority trial, 133 patients were randomised between doxorubicin (n =43), trabectedin (3-hour infusion, T3h) (n =47) and trabectedin (24-hour infusion, T24h) (n =43). PFS was defined as time from random assignment until objective progression by response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1), a global deterioration of the health status requiring discontinuation of the treatment, or death from any cause.   Results The study was terminated due to lack of superiority in both trabectedin treatment arms as compared to the doxorubicin control arm. Median PFS was 2.8months in the T3h arm, 3.1months in the T24h arm and 5.5months in the doxorubicin arm. No significant improvements in PFS were observed in the trabectedin arms as compared to the doxorubicin arm (T24h versus doxorubicin: hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67\u20131.90, P =.675; T3h versus doxorubicin: HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.91\u20132.48, P =.944). Only one toxic death occurred in the T3h arm, but treatment had to be stopped due to toxicity in 7 (15.2%) (T3h), 8 (19.5%) (T24h) and 1 (2.5%) doxorubicin patients.   Conclusion Doxorubicin continues to be the standard treatment in eligible patients with advanced/metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Trabectedin 1.5mg/m2/24-hour infusion is the overall proven approach to delivering this agent in the second-line setting for patients with advanced or metastatic STS. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

This suggests that the current Tumour-Node-Metastasis staging systems need to be refined. The nomogram is a useful predictive tool that integrates individual variables into a statistical model to predict outcome of interest. This study was to design predictive nomograms based on the clinical and pathological features of patients with NPC.   Materials and methods Clinical data of 270 NPC patients who underwent definitive radiation therapy (RT) alone or concurrent with chemotherapy were collected. Factors predictive of response to RT and overall survival (OS) were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses, and predictive nomograms were created. Nomograms were validated externally by assessing discrimination and calibration using an independent data set (N =122).   Results Three variables predictive of response to RT (age, histology classification and N classification) and four predictive of OS (age, performance status, smoking status and N classification), in addition to T classification, were extracted to generate the nomograms. The nomograms were validated externally, which showed perfect correlation with each other.   Conclusion The designed nomograms proved highly predictive of response to RT and OS in individual patients, and could facilitate individualised and personalised patients\u2019 counselling and care. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

This meta-analysis characterises liver chemistry abnormalities associated with pazopanib. Data of pazopanib-treated patients from nine prospective trials were integrated (N =2080). Laboratory datasets were used to characterise the incidence, timing, recovery and patterns of liver events, and subsequent rechallenge with pazopanib. Severe cases of liver chemistry abnormalities were clinically reviewed. Multivariate analyses identified predisposing factors. Twenty percent of patients developed elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3\u00d7ULN. Incidence of peak ALT &gt;3\u20135\u00d7ULN, &gt;5\u20138\u00d7ULN, &gt;8\u201320\u00d7ULN and &gt;20\u00d7ULN was 8%, 5%, 5% and 1%, respectively. Median time to onset for all events was 42days; 91% of events were observed within 18weeks. Recovery rates based on peak ALT &gt;3\u20135\u00d7ULN, &gt;5\u20138\u00d7ULN, &gt;8-20\u00d7ULN and &gt;20\u00d7ULN were 91%, 90%, 90% and 64%, respectively. Median time from onset to recovery was 30days, but longer in patients without dose interruption. Based on clinical review, no deaths were associated with drug-induced liver injury. Overall, 38% of rechallenged patients had ALT elevation recurrence, with 9-day median time to recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that older age was associated with development of ALT &gt;8\u00d7ULN. There was no correlation between hypertension and transaminitis. Our data support the current guidelines on regular liver chemistry tests after initiation of pazopanib, especially during the first 9 or 10weeks, and also demonstrate the safety of rechallenge with pazopanib. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Siu , Kelvin K.W.  Chan<br>\n<br>\n Background Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CRT-A) is often the regimen of choice in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Many alternative regimens have been reported in the literature, however, it is unknown how effective these regimens are compared to each other due to the lack of direct comparisons. Our objective was to perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine the relative survival benefits of these treatments for locoregionally advanced NPC.   Methods We performed a systematic review following the Cochrane methodology, using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemoradiotherapy regimens for locoregionally advanced NPC. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome of interest, and hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted using the Parmar method. Bayesian NMAs with random effects were conducted using WinBUGS.   Results Twenty-five RCTs (5576 patients) were included in this review. All together, these trials compared seven different regimens: radiotherapy (RT), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), neoadjuvant followed by CRT (N-CRT), CRT-A, RT-A, N-RT and N-RT-A. All regimens that contained CRT performed significantly better than RT. CRT-A did not improve survival compared to CRT alone (0.98; 95% credible regions: 0.71\u20131.34). For N-CRT versus CRT, the HR was 1.03 (0.69\u20131.47). When CRT-A was compared against N-CRT, the resulting HR was 0.96 (0.64\u20131.48).   Conclusions Adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to improve survival following CRT. The efficacies of CRT, CRT-A and N-CRT all appeared to be similar. Further studies are warranted to determine the value of additional chemotherapy phases in specific patient subgroups. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Tammela , Peter  Iversen<br>\n<br>\n Background The optimal timing of endocrine therapy in non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is still an issue of debate.   Methods A randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing bicalutamide 150mg once daily with placebo in addition to standard care in patients with hormone-na\u00efve, non-metastatic PCa. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was performed to analyse time-to-event (death).   Findings A total of 1218 patients were included into the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG)-6 study of which 607 were randomised to receive bicalutamide in addition to their standard care and 611 to receive placebo. Median follow-up was 14.6years. Overall, 866 (71.1%) patients died, 428 (70.5%) in the bicalutamide arm and 438 (71.7%) in the placebo arm, p =0.87. Bicalutamide significantly improved OS in patient with locally advanced disease (hazard ratios (HR)=0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63\u20130.94, p =0.01), regardless of baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA), with a survival benefit which was apparent throughout the study period. In contrast, survival favoured randomisation to the placebo arm in patients with localised disease (HR=1.19 (95% CI: 1.00\u20131.43), p =0.056). However, a survival gain from bicalutamide therapy was present in patients with localised disease and a baseline PSA greater than 28ng/mL at randomisation. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, only including patients managed on watchful waiting as their standard of care (n =991) OS depended on age, World Health Organisation (WHO) grade, baseline PSA, clinical stage and randomised treatment.   Interpretation Throughout the 14.6year follow-up period the addition of early bicalutamide to standard of care resulted in a significant OS benefit in patients with locally advanced PCa. In contrast, patients with localised PCa and low PSA derived no survival benefit from early bicalutamide. The optimal timing for initiating bicalutamide in non-metastatic PCa patients is dependent on disease stage and baseline PSA. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Little is known about the feasibility and safety of aprepitant in patients treated with oxaliplatin.   Methods In this multicentre, open label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with colorectal cancer who underwent an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients were centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (5-HT3-receptor antagonist+dexamethasone) or aprepitant group (5-HT3-receptor antagonist+dexamethasone+aprepitant or fosaprepitant) in the first course. All patients were treated with aprepitant/fosaprepitant therapy in the second course. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients with no emesis.   Results A total of 413 patients entered this clinical trial from 25 centres in Japan. Significantly more patients in the aprepitant group achieved no vomiting overall and delayed phase than those in the control group (95.7% versus 83.6%, and 95.7% versus 84.7%, respectively). The aprepitant group also had statistically significantly higher percentages of no significant nausea, complete response and complete protection than the control group overall. In the control group, the percentages of no vomiting were higher in the second cycle than in the first cycle. The incidence of vomiting occurred day 7 or later was significantly higher in the control group compared with the aprepitant group. Other adverse events were not significant between the groups.   Conclusion The aprepitant therapy was more effective than the control therapy for prevention of CINV in colorectal cancer patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based regimen. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Results were stratified for those aged &lt;70 and \u2a7e70years. HRQoL of patients was also compared with an age- and sex-matched normative population.   Methods Patients diagnosed with colon cancer between January 2000 and June 2009, as registered within the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a questionnaire on HRQoL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0 (QLQ-C30)) and disease-specific symptoms (EORTC QLQ-Colorectal 38 (EORTC QLQ-CR38)) in 2010. The first was also completed by the normative population (n =685).   Results 1606 (72%) colon cancer survivors responded to our questionnaire. 1542 colon cancer patients treated with SU (n =1031) or SU+adjCT (n =493) were included in this study. In colon cancer patients aged &lt;70years and aged \u2a7e70 no statistical significant differences on the subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 or the EORTC QLQ-CR38 were observed between patients treated with SU and SU+adjCT.

Objective response rates (RR) reported for streptozocin (STZ)-based chemotherapy are variable and novel targeted drugs have recently been approved. However, the sequence of treatment remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of STZ plus 5-fluorouracil (STZ/5-FU) in a large pNET cohort.   Methods Data from 96 pNET patients treated with STZ/5-FU were analysed retrospectively. Endpoints of the study were RR, time to tumour progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).   Results Mean age of patients at the start of chemotherapy was 57.6years (range, 32.1\u201380.4). STZ/5-FU was the 1st line treatment in 56.3%. 11.5% had G1, 79.2% G2 and 6.3% G3 neoplasms. Baseline progression was evident in 74%. Objective response rate was 42.7%. 40.6% of patients showed stable disease as best response while 16.7% showed progressive disease. Treatment was discontinued due to toxicity in 16 patients. Median TTP and OS were 19.4 (95% confidence interval (CI), 13.6\u201325.2) and 54.8months (95% CI, 34.7\u201374.9), respectively. In Cox regression analysis, Ki67&gt;15% was the only negative prognostic factor for TTP (hazard ratio (HR), 3.3; P &lt;0.001), confirmed by multivariate analysis (HR, 6.7; P =0.001).   Conclusions STZ/5-FU was associated with considerable RR. Treatment was associated with durable TTP especially in patients with Ki67-index of \u2a7d15%. These findings along with good tolerability strengthen the value of this two-drug chemotherapy for the management of unresectable pNET. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Lenz , V.  Heinemann , U.  Klinkhardt , F.  Beier , K.  Duecker , J.H.  van Krieken , S.  Tejpar<br>\n<br>\n Background The OPUS study demonstrated that addition of cetuximab to 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) significantly improved objective response and progression-free survival (PFS) in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In patients with KRAS exon 2 mutations, a detrimental effect was seen upon addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4. The current study reports outcomes in subgroups defined by extended RAS testing.   Patients and methods Samples from OPUS study KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours were reanalysed for other RAS mutations in four additional KRAS codons (exons 3\u20134) and six NRAS codons (exons 2\u20134) using BEAMing. A cutoff of \u2a7e5% mutant/wild-type sequences was selected to define RAS status; we also report an analysis using a cutoff based on the technical lower limit for mutation identification (0.1%).   Results Other RAS mutations were detected in 31/118 (26%) evaluable patients. In the extended analysis of RAS wild-type tumours (n =87), objective response was significantly improved by addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 (58% versus 29%; odds ratio 3.33 [95% confidence interval 1.36\u20138.17]; P =0.0084); although limited by population size, there also appeared to be trends favouring the cetuximab arm in terms of PFS and overall survival in the RAS wild-type group compared with the RAS evaluable group. There was no evidence that patients with other RAS mutations benefited from cetuximab, but small numbers precluded precise estimations of treatment effects. In the combined population of patients with any RAS mutation (KRAS exon 2 or other RAS), a clear detrimental effect was associated with addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4.   Conclusion Patients with RAS-mutant mCRC, as defined by mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2\u20134, derive no benefit and may be harmed by the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4. Restricting cetuximab administration to patients with RAS wild-type tumours will further tailor therapy to maximise benefit. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Audisio<br>\n<br>\n Objective The aim of this study is to assess age-specific compliance to quality indicators (QIs) regarding the treatment of breast cancer as defined by European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA) for patients across Europe.   Methods All patients entered into this study were affected by in situ or invasive breast cancer, diagnosed and treated between 2003 and 2012 at 27 Breast Units across Europe, who were entered into the EUSOMA database. Patients were categorised according to age; compliance to thirteen QIs was assessed for each age group and per time period (2003\u20132007 and 2008\u20132012). Compliance to QIs was tested by multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for breast unit, incidence year and tumour characteristics.   Results Overall, 41,871 patients with a mean age of 59.6years were available for analysis. The highest compliance was reached for patients aged 55\u201364years and in the time period 2008\u20132012, whilst the lowest compliance was observed for women aged over 74 or under 40years and in the earlier time period. In multivariable logistic regression models, a significant difference between age categories was shown for 12 out of 13 QIs (P &lt;0.001). Compliance to the QIs for patients aged \u2a7e75years was significantly lower when compared to patients aged 55\u201364years for ten QIs, whilst for patients in the youngest age group this was true for seven QIs.   Conclusion In conclusion, we found that among the 27 included breast units across Europe, compliance to QIs for breast cancer treatment is often lower in the youngest and oldest breast cancer patients, with a tendency to overtreatment in the youngest patients, and to under-treatment in the elderly. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Fulvestrant inhibits and downregulates the oestrogen receptor. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the major cascades involved in resistance to endocrine therapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant with selumetinib, a MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced stage breast cancer progressing after aromatase inhibitor (AI).   Patients and methods This randomised phase II trial included postmenopausal patients with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. They were ramdomised to fulvestrant combined with selumetinib or placebo. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) in the experimental arm. ClinicalTrials.gov Indentifier: NCT01160718.   Results Following the planned interim efficacy analysis, recruitment was interrupted after the inclusion of 46 patients (23 in each arm), because the selumetinib\u2013fulvestrant arm did not reach the pre-specified DCR. DCR was 23% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8\u201345%) in the selumetinib arm and 50% (95% CI 27\u201375%) in the placebo arm. Median progression-free survival was 3.7months (95% CI 1.9\u20135.8) in the selumetinib arm and 5.6months (95% CI 3.4\u201313.6) in the placebo arm. Median time to treatment failure was 5.1 (95% CI 2.3\u20136.7) and 5.6 (95% CI 3.4\u201310.2) months, respectively. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events observed in the selumetinib\u2013fulvestrant arm were skin disorders, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, oedema, diarrhoea, mouth disorders and muscle disorders.   Conclusions The addition of selumetinib to fulvestrant did not show improving patients\u2019 outcome and was poorly tolerated at the recommended monotherapy dose. Selumetinib may have deteriorated the efficacy of the endocrine therapy in some patients. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Although cancer in childhood is rare increasingly effective treatments have led to a growing number of long-term survivors. It is estimated that there are between 300,000 and 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in Europe. Such good survival prospects raise important questions relating to late effects of treatment for cancer. Research has shown that the majority will suffer adverse health outcomes and premature mortality compared with the general population. While chronic health conditions are common among childhood cancer survivors, each specific type of late effect is very rare. Long-term effects must be considered particularly when addressing complex multimodality treatments, and taking into account the interaction between aspects of treatment and genotype. The PanCare Network was set up across Europe in order to effectively answer many of these questions and thereby improve the care and quality of life of survivors. The need for a structured long-term follow-up system after childhood cancer has been recognised for some time and strategies for implementation have been developed, first nationally and then trans-nationally, across Europe. Since its first meeting in Lund in 2008, the goal of the PanCare Network has been to coordinate and implement these strategies to ensure that every European survivor of childhood and adolescent cancer receives optimal long\u2010term care. This paper will outline the structure and work of the PanCare Network, including the results of several European surveys, the start of two EU-funded projects and interactions with relevant stakeholders and related projects. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Petridou<br>\n<br>\n Aim Following completion of the first 5-year nationwide childhood (0\u201314years) registration in Greece, central nervous system (CNS) tumour incidence rates are compared with those of 12 registries operating in 10 Southern\u2013Eastern European countries.   Methods All CNS tumours, as defined by the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC-3) and registered in any period between 1983 and 2014 were collected from the collaborating cancer registries. Data were evaluated using standard International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) criteria. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates (AIR) by age/gender/diagnostic subgroup were calculated, whereas time trends were assessed through Poisson and Joinpoint regression models.   Results 6062 CNS tumours were retrieved with non-malignant CNS tumours recorded in eight registries; therefore, the analyses were performed on 5191 malignant tumours. Proportion of death certificate only cases was low and morphologic verification overall high; yet five registries presented &gt;10% unspecified neoplasms. The male/female ratio was 1.3 and incidence decreased gradually with age, apart from Turkey and Ukraine. Overall AIR for malignant tumours was 23/106 children, with the highest rates noted in Croatia and Serbia. A statistically significant AIR increase was noted in Bulgaria, whereas significant decreases were noted in Belarus, Croatia, Cyprus and Serbia. Although astrocytomas were overall the most common subgroup (30%) followed by embryonal tumours (26%), the latter was the predominant subgroup in six registries.   Conclusion Childhood cancer registration is expanding in Southern\u2013Eastern Europe. The heterogeneity in registration practices and incidence patterns of CNS tumours necessitates further investigation aiming to provide clues in aetiology and direct investments into surveillance and early tumour detection. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Methods Patient-level data were combined from two identically designed, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase III trials of advanced cancer patients with breast cancer and other solid tumours (excluding breast or prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma. End-points included time to first on-study HCM, time to first and subsequent on-study HCM, proportion of patients experiencing HCM and proportion of patients experiencing recurrent HCM.   Results Denosumab significantly delayed the time to first on-study HCM, representing a 37% reduction in the hazard ratio (HR) compared with zoledronic acid (HR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41\u20130.98; P =0.042) and reduced the risk of developing recurrent HCM (time to first and subsequent on-study HCM) by 52% (rate ratio, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29\u20130.81; P =0.006).

Kim<br>\n<br>\n Introduction Vemurafenib induces tumour regression in most patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma; eventually, most experience progressive disease (PD). Long-term follow-up of patients with BRAF V600E melanoma treated in the phase 1 vemurafenib trial is reported.   Methods Patients received vemurafenib 240\u20131120mg (dose escalation cohort) or 960mg (extension cohort) orally twice daily. Clinical response was evaluated every 8weeks by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Patients with PD amenable to local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) were allowed to continue vemurafenib after progression. Overall survival (OS) from time of treatment initiation and from PD was estimated. Sites of PD were recorded.   Results Forty-eight patients (escalation cohort, n =16; extension cohort, n =32) received therapeutic doses of vemurafenib (\u2a7e240mg twice daily). Forty-four patients had PD by the time of this analysis and four remained progression free (follow-up time, 1.2\u201356.1months). Median OS was 14months (range, 1.2\u201356.1); 3- and 4-year melanoma-specific survival rate in the extension cohort was 26% and 19%, respectively. Median OS was 26.0months (range, 7.7\u201356.1) among 20 patients who continued vemurafenib after local therapy. Median treatment duration beyond initial PD was 3.8months (range, 1.1\u201326.6). In the extension cohort, six and five patients were alive after 3 and 4years, respectively, on vemurafenib monotherapy.   Conclusions Some patients with melanoma achieved long-term survival with vemurafenib monotherapy. Continuation of vemurafenib after PD might be beneficial in some patients because remaining disease might continue to respond to BRAF inhibition. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Merks<br>\n<br>\n Background Radiotherapy is a well-known cause of adverse events (AEs). To reduce AEs, an innovative local treatment was developed in Amsterdam: Ablative surgery, MOuld brachytherapy and surgical REconstruction (AMORE).  Aims: (1) to determine the prevalence of AEs in HNRMS survivors and (2) to compare AEs between survivors treated with the international standard: external beam radiotherapy (EBRT-based: London) and survivors treated with AMORE if feasible, otherwise EBRT (AMORE-based: Amsterdam).   Methods All HNRMS survivors, treated in London or Amsterdam between January 1990 and December 2010 (n =153), and alive \u2a7e2years post-treatment were eligible (n =113). A predefined list of AEs was assessed in a multidisciplinary clinic and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.   Results Eighty HNRMS survivors attended the clinic (median follow-up 10.5years); 63% experienced \u2a7e1 severe or disabling event, and 76% had \u2a7e5 AEs (any grade). Survivors with EBRT-based treatment were, after adjustment for site, age at diagnosis, and follow-up duration, at increased risk to develop any grade 3/4 event or \u2a7e5 AEs (any grade) compared with survivors with AMORE-based treatments (p =0.032 and 0.01, respectively). Five year overall survival (source population) after EBRT-based treatment was 75.0%, after AMORE-based treatment 76.9%, p =0.56.   Conclusion This study may serve as a baseline inventory and can be used in future studies for prospective assessments of AEs following the introduction of novel local treatment modalities. AMORE-based local treatment resulted in similar overall survival and a reduction of AEs secondary to local treatment. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

SurePath samples were collected from 1278 women undergoing routine cytology-based screening. Abnormal cytology was managed according to the routine recommendations, and women with cytology-normal/HPV-positive samples were invited for repeated cytology and HPV testing in 1.5years. Loss to follow-up was similar between HPV assays. \u2a7eCIN3 was detected in 44 women. The sensitivity of HC2 for \u2a7eCIN3 was 95% (95% confidence interval (CI): 85\u201399), of cobas 98% (95% CI: 88\u2013100), of CLART 100% (95% CI: 92\u2013100), of APTIMA 82% (95% CI: 67\u201392), and of cytology 59% (95% CI: 43\u201374).

Similar results were observed for \u2a7eCIN2 (N =68). HPV screening with cytological triage doubled the number of colposcopies compared to cytology screening, and increased the frequency of repeated testing by four (APTIMA) to seven (cobas) times. The positive predictive value of a referral for colposcopy was relatively high for all screening tests (\u2a7e30% for \u2a7eCIN3, and \u2a7e50% for \u2a7eCIN2). CIN1 was detected by cytology in \u223c1% of women, and in \u223c2% by any of the four HPV assays.

Sturgis , Yan  Sun , Chuanzheng  Sun , Qingyi  Wei , Zhigang  Huang , Guojun  Li<br>\n<br>\n Background Genetic polymorphisms in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTRs) targeted by miRNAs alter the strength of miRNA binding in a manner that affects the behaviour of individual miRNAs. An insertion (Ins)/deletion (Del) polymorphism (rs3783553) in the 3\u2032 UTR of IL-1\u03b1 may disrupt a binding site for miRNA-122. IL-1\u03b1 plays an important role in inflammation, immunity and defense against infection. Thus, we hypothesised that the rs3783553 polymorphism affects individual susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).   Methods We genotyped the rs3783553 polymorphism; and determined HPV16 L1 serology, tumour HPV16 DNA and serum IL-1\u03b1 expression. Univariate/multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate associations.   Results We found that HPV16 L1 seropositivity alone was associated with an increased risk of OSCC (Odds ratio (OR), 3.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1\u20134.6), and the risk of HPV16-associated OSCC was modified by the rs3783553 polymorphism. Patients with both HPV16 L1 seropositivity and Del/Del genotype for the rs3783553 had the highest risk of OSCC when using patients with HPV16 L1 seronegativity and Ins/Del+Ins/Ins genotypes as a comparison group. Notably, that effect modification was particularly pronounced in several subgroups (e.g. SCCOP, never-smokers and never-drinkers). The patients with Del/Del genotype were approximately 3.0 times more likely to have HPV16-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) tumours compared to those patients with Ins/Del+Ins/Ins genotypes. Additionally, functional relevance of this variant was characterised to explore the genotype\u2013phenotype correlation.   Conclusion These results suggest that IL-1\u03b1 3\u2032 UTR rs3783553 polymorphism may be functional and influence susceptibility to HPV16-associated OSCC, particularly for SCCOP. Validation of our findings is warranted. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Goodwin<br>\n<br>\n Background Right- and left-sided colon cancers (RC, LC) differ with respect to biology, pathology and epidemiology. Previous data suggest a mortality difference between RC and LC. We examined if primary tumour side also predicts for outcome in chemotherapy refractory, metastatic colon cancer (MCC). We also compared RC versus LC as a predictor of efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition with cetuximab.   Methods Reanalyzing NCIC CO.17 trial (cetuximab versus best supportive care [BSC]), we coded the primary tumour side as RC (caecum to transverse colon) or LC (splenic flexure to rectosigmoid). The association between tumour side and baseline characteristics was assessed. Cox regression models determined factors affecting overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).   Results Patients with RC (150/399) had more poorly differentiated, mutant KRAS, mutated PIK3CA and wild-type BRAF tumours, fewer liver and lung metastases, and shorter interval between diagnosis and study entry. Among BSC patients, tumour side was not prognostic for PFS (hazard ratios (HR) 1.07 [0.79\u20131.44], p =0.67) or OS (HR 0.96 [0.70\u20131.31], p =0.78). Among wild-type KRAS patients, those with LC had significantly improved PFS when treated with cetuximab compared to BSC (median 5.4 versus 1.8months, HR 0.28 [0.18\u20130.45], p &lt;0.0001), whereas those with RC did not (median 1.9 versus 1.9months, HR 0.73 [0.42\u20131.27], p =0.26), [interaction p =0.002].   Conclusion In refractory MCC, tumour location within the colon is not prognostic, but is strongly predictive of PFS benefit from cetuximab therapy. Additional research is needed to understand the molecular differences between RC and LC and their interaction with EGFR inhibition. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

However, the value of serum CA19-9 as a biomarker of response to chemotherapy in bile duct cancer is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine if a decline in CA19-9 (CA19-9 response) during chemotherapy is predictive of survival in patients with inoperable bile duct cancer.   Methods Consecutive patients with inoperable bile duct cancer treated at a University Hospital were retrospectively included in an investigational cohort (n=212). Three validation cohorts were established including patients 1) participating in phase I/II trials at a Danish Hospital (n=71), 2) identified retrospectively in a Canadian cohort (n=196) and 3) randomized in the ABC-02 trial (n=410). Patients with a baseline CA19-9 and at least one CA19-9 value measured 10-12 weeks after the start of chemotherapy were included. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.   Results Patients meeting the criteria to be included were 54 in the investigational cohort and 34, 68 and 148 in the three validation sets, respectively. Multivariate analysis included radiological response, performance status, bilirubin, gender, site of cancer, extend of disease, CA19-9 at baseline and age. A hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 (95%CI: 0.44-0.80, p =0.0005) for death in CA19-9 responders was reached in the investigational cohort. The predictive value of CA 19-9 response was confirmed in all three validation cohorts.

Jiao , Justin  Stebbing<br>\n<br>\n Background Reports have described the prognostic relevance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in patients treated for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, many of these include small numbers of patients. To increase statistical power and improve translation, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine a pooled conclusion. We examined the impact of miRNAs on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in PDAC.   Methods Eligible studies were identified and quality assessed using multiple search strategies (last search December 2014). Data were collected from studies correlating clinical outcomes with dysregulated tumoural or blood miRNAs. Studies were pooled, and combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate strength of the associations.   Results Twenty studies involving 1525 patients treated for PDAC were included. After correcting for publication bias, OS was significantly shortened in patients with high tumoural miR-21 (adjusted HR=2.48; 1.96\u20133.14). This result persisted when only studies adjusting for adjuvant chemotherapy were combined (adjusted HR=2.72; 1.91\u20133.89). High miR-21 also predicted reduced DFS (adjusted HR=3.08; 1.78\u20135.33). Similarly, we found significant adjusted HRs for poor OS for high miR-155, high miR-203, and low miR-34a; and unadjusted HRs for high miR-222 and high miR-10b. The small number of studies, limited number of miRNAs and paucity of multivariate analyses are the limitations of our study.   Conclusions This is the first rigorous pooled analysis assessing miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in PDAC. Tumoural miR-21 overexpression emerged as an important predictor of poor prognosis after PDAC resection independent of other clinicopathologic factors, including adjuvant chemotherapy use. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Monotherapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies may be an option for these patients with few systemic toxic effects.   Patients and methods Single-arm, multicentre, phase II trial including patients \u2a7e70years with wild-type (WT) KRAS (exon 2) mCRC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status\u2a7d3, KPC (K\u00f6hne Prognostic Classification) \u2013 defined intermediate or high risk status, frailty and/or ineligibility for chemotherapy. Patients received panitumumab until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point was progression free survival (PFS) rate at 6months.   Results The study included 33 patients (intention-to-treat (ITT) population). Median age: 81years; sex: 66.7% male; high-risk KPC status: 45.4%. Median treatment duration was 14weeks and 6-month PFS rate was 36.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.0\u201352.8). The objective response rate: 9.1% (95% CI: 0\u201318.9) (all partial responses), and there were 18 stable diseases (54.5%). Median PFS was 4.3months (95% CI: 2.8\u20136.4) and median overall survival (OS) was 7.1months (95% CI: 5.0\u201312.3). There were no deaths or grade 4\u20135 adverse events (AEs) related to panitumumab and the most common grade 3-related AE was rash acneiform (15.2%). A significant association between clinical response and RAS status was observed (P =0.037).

The aim of this study is to examine the joint impact of CRF and CRP in predicting lung cancer risk.   Methods A population-based cohort study of 2276 men with no history of cancer was carried out. Baseline measures of CRP and CRF were divided into median values and categorised. During an average follow-up of 21-years, 73 cases of lung cancer occurred.   Results In a multivariate model, men with the combination of high CRP (&gt;50% 1.24mg/l) and low CRF (maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)&lt;50% 30.08ml/kg/min) had a fourfold (relative risk (RR) 4.19 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66\u201310.57, p &lt;0.01) risk of lung cancer as compared to the reference group of low CRP (&lt;50% 1.24mg/l) and high CRF (VO2max&gt;50% 30.08ml/kg/min). Furthermore, men categorised in high CRP and combined with either low/high CRF, had an increased risk for lung cancer as compared to reference group. In further separate independent analysis for CRP and CRF, lung cancer risk was threefold for high CRP (RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.44\u20137.20, p &lt;0.01) and low CRF (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.27\u20137.78, p =0.01) as compared to reference CRP (&gt;2.38mg/l) and CRF (&gt;35.15ml/kg/min).

Recent randomised trials show that most elderly patients do not benefit from RT. We started a prospective non-randomised trial to address this issue in 1987 and now present results for the 627 consecutive pT1/2cN0 patients recruited, and treated by conservative surgery (quadrantectomy) and tamoxifen, and assigned non-randomly to RT or no RT.   Methods We used multivariate competing risks models to estimate 15-crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR), distant metastasis and breast cancer mortality. The models incorporated a propensity score as a measure of probability of receiving RT based on baseline characteristics, to account for the lack of randomisation.   Results For pT1 patients, 15-year CCIs of IBTR, distant metastasis and breast cancer death were indistinguishable in the RT and no RT groups. For pT2 patients, 15-year CCI of IBTR was much higher in those not given RT (14.6% versus 0.8%, p =0.004), although breast cancer mortality and distant metastasis did not differ significantly between RT and no RT.   Conclusions Consistent with the findings of recent randomised trials, our long-term data indicate that most elderly, ER-positive patients with pT1 cN0 breast cancer treated by quadrantectomy do not benefit from RT. The 14.6% CCI of IBTR in our pT2 patients is an additional finding not presented in the trials and suggests that RT should be administered to elderly patients with pT2 disease. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Rutten<br>\n<br>\n Background Young patients with rectal cancer tend to present with more advanced-stage disease and unfavourable tumour morphology. The effects of these tumour characteristics on survival in this particular patient group are unclear.   Methods Population-based data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) were used. Data from patients diagnosed with rectal cancer between 1989 and 2010 were selected. Younger patients (\u2a7d40years) were compared with middle-aged patients (41\u201370years) with respect to disease stage, tumour characteristics, treatment and outcomes. Patients aged older than 70years were excluded. Relative excess risk (RER) models were used to perform uni- and multivariate survival analyses.   Findings A total of 37.056 patients were included (\u2a7d40years n =1.102). Compared with middle-aged patients, young patients were more likely to have stage III (33.8% versus 27.8%) and stage IV (24.3% versus 19.6%) disease (p &lt;0.001). Young patients also presented more frequently with mucinous tumours (10.8% versus 9.0%), signet cell carcinomas (2.6% versus 0.6%) and poorly differentiated tumours (16.6% versus 12.3%) (p =0.001). The treatment of stage I\u2013III patients did not differ between the two groups, except regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, which was more often given to young patients (24.3% versus 14.4%, p &lt;0.001). Young age was a prognostic factor for better survival in stage I\u2013III patients (RER 0.82 CI 0.71\u20130.94).

In an exploratory analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy in young stage III and pN1 patients was associated with improved survival.   Concluding statement Young patients present with more advanced disease and have more unfavourable tumour characteristics compared with middle-aged patients. Despite these characteristics, survival rates are equal, and young age is a prognostic factor for better survival. Although the use of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial, a positive correlation with survival was found in this study. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Patients and methods Cardiac follow-up and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) assessment by echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan were performed every 3months while patients received trastuzumab and after completion of treatment over the first 2years and every 6months afterwards. The primary cardiac end-point was Cardiac Heart Failure (CHF) defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. The secondary cardiac end-points were: cardiac events, cardiac dysfunctions defined by NYHA class I and II; LVEF decreases, cardiac recoveries. The cardiac subcommittee reviewed cardiac events and assessed if patients had favourable outcomes or not on the basis of trends from LVEF measurements.   Results Among 3380 patients the cardiac dysfunction assessment included 14,055 and 13,218 LVEF measurements in the 12- and 6-month arms. The overall incidences of CHF were 0.65% (11/1690) and 0.53% (9/1690) in the 12 and 6month arms, respectively (p &gt;0.05). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 5.9% (100/1690) and 3.4% (58/1690) of patients in the 12 and 6month arms, respectively (p =0.001). Recoveries were observed for the majority patients and 0.79% (27/3380) of patients experienced an unfavourable cardiac outcome.   Conclusion PHARE confirm that the incidence of cardiac end-points remains low and mostly reversible after trastuzumab.

One of these trials, FFCD 9102, randomised only fit, compliant and operable responders to induction chemoradiation between continuation of chemoradiation and surgery. In the present analysis, the outcome in the patients not eligible for randomisation was calculated to determine if attempt of surgery should be recommended.   Methods Eligible patients had operable T3-N0/N1-M0 thoracic oesophageal cancer. After initial chemoradiation, patients with no clinical response, or with contraindication to follow any attributed treatment, were not randomised. OS was studied first in the whole population of not randomised patients, and then specifically in clinical non-responders. The impact of surgery on OS was studied in these two populations.   Findings Of the 451 registered patients in the trial, 192 were not randomised. Among them, 111 were clinical non-responders. Median OS was significantly shorter for non-randomised patients (11.5months) than for randomised patients (18.9months; p =0.0024).

Concerning clinical non-responders, median OS was longer for those who underwent surgery compared to non-operated patients: 17.0 versus 5.5months (hazard ratio (HR)=0.39 [0.25\u20130.61]; p &lt;0.0001), and again was not different from that in responding, randomised patients (p =0.40).   Interpretation In patients with locally advanced thoracic oesophageal cancer, overall survival did not differ between responders to induction chemoradiation and patients having surgery after clinical failure of chemoradiation. Surgery should therefore be considered in those patients who are still operable. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Here we report prespecified secondary response\u2013related end-points and exploratory TS/resection outcomes for patients with RAS wild-type (WT) tumours (no mutations in KRAS/NRAS exons 2/3/4) from the PRIME study (NCT00364013).   Methods PRIME was a randomised phase 3 study comparing first-line panitumumab+FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 in mCRC patients. Tumour response analyses were conducted to compare response rates and their impact on survival outcomes.   Results Overall, 505 patients had RAS WT mCRC. More patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 had \u2a7e30% (59% versus 38%; P &lt;0.001) or \u2a7e20% (72% versus 57%; P &lt;0.001) TS at week 8 (early TS); consistent TS benefits were observed over the first \u223c40weeks of treatment. Objective response rate (P =0.003), duration of response (P =0.0027), depth of response (P =0.0149), progression-free survival (PFS; P =0.0015) and overall survival (OS; P =0.0057) were improved in the panitumumab+FOLFOX4 group. Both early TS and resection were associated with improved PFS and OS. 2-year OS rates for patients who did (n =64) versus did not (n =441) undergo resection were 88% versus 40%; 2-year OS rates for patients who did (n =45) versus did not (n =460) undergo complete resection were 96% versus 41%.   Conclusions More patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 had \u2a7e30% or \u2a7e20% TS at week 8; PFS and OS were also improved with panitumumab+FOLFOX4. The clinical value of achieving early TS in mCRC warrants further investigation. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Dysregulation of the members of this pathway involves in the development of cancer and an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) required for metastasis. Loss of E-cadherin is the major contributor to an EMT process and is largely influenced by the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signalling. An E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complex maintains epithelial integrity and disturbance of this complex and WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway will ultimately lead to the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and transcription of EMT-promoting genes. WNT/\u03b2-catenin signalling is controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs), several of which are either up- or downregulated during EMT. The strong association between the expression of the WNT signalling components with miRNAs in the initiation and achievement of an EMT phenotype is suggestive of introducing these miRNAs as therapeutic targets against metastatic tumours. Therefore, this review aims to describe these putative miRNAs in altering the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signalling in EMT, and whether targeting them is a useful therapeutic option for human invasive tumours. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Methods We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) of a pre-defined set of 48 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 76 neurosurgical lung adenocarcinoma BM specimens using a cancer specific gene panel on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). NGS results were statistically correlated to patient characteristics. Data on ALK, ROS1, MET and FGFR1 gene status assessed by FISH were available from previous studies in the majority of patients.   Results Twenty-nine (60.4%) of the 48 investigated cancer-related genes were mutated in at least one BM sample and 64 (84.2%) of the 76BM samples carried at least one mutated gene. The number of mutated genes per sample ranged from 0 to 9 (median 2). The most commonly mutated genes were TP53, KRAS and CDKN2A, which were affected in 35/76 (46.1%), 29/76 (38.2%) and 17/76 (22.4%) samples, respectively. Other potentially druggable alterations included EGFR mutations (3/76, 3.9% of samples), PIK3CA mutation (2/76, 2.6%), BRAF mutation (1/76, 1.3%) and SMO mutation (1/76, 1.3%). Presence of KRAS mutations was associated with positive smoking history (p =0.015, Chi square test) and presence of EGFR mutation correlated with unfavourable overall survival time from BM diagnosis (p =0.019, log rank test).

Methods We used population-based cancer registry data, supplemented by information on PSA testing, life expectancy and mortality from Lithuania to examine age-specific prostate cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends among men aged 40+ between 1978 and 2009, as well as life expectancy of screening-eligible men, and the proportion of men with a first PSA test per year since the programme started.   Results The number of prostate cancer patients rose from 2.237 in 1990\u20131994 to 15.294 in 2005\u20132009. By 2010, around 70% of the eligible population was tested, on average around two times. The early detection programme brought about the highest prostate cancer incidence peaks ever seen in a country to date. Recent incidence and survival rises in the age groups 75\u201384 suggest PSA testing in the elderly non-eligible population. Life expectancy of men aged 70\u201374 indicates that less than 30% of patients will live for 15years and may have a chance to benefit from early detection.   Conclusions Early detection among men aged 70\u201374, and particularly among the elderly (75+) may have to be reconsidered. Life expectancy assessment before testing, avoiding a second test among men with low PSA values and increasing the threshold for further evaluation and the screening interval may help reducing harm. Publishing information on treatment modalities, side-effects and patient reported quality of life is recommended. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Patients and methods This multicentre prospective cohort study involved 58 palliative care services, including 19 hospital palliative care teams, 16 palliative care units and 23 home palliative care services, in Japan from September 2012 to April 2014. Analyses were performed involving four patient groups: those treated by palliative care teams, those in palliative care units, those at home and those receiving chemotherapy.   Results We recruited 2426 participants, and 2361 patients were finally analysed. Risk groups based on these instruments successfully identified patients with different survival profiles in all groups. The feasibility of PPI and modified PiPS-A was more than 90% in all groups, followed by PaP and D-PaP scores; modified PiPS-B had the lowest feasibility. The accuracy of prognostic scores was \u2a7e69% in all groups and the difference was within 13%, while c-statistics were significantly lower with the PPI than PaP and D-PaP scores.   Conclusion The PaP score, D-PaP score, PPI and modified PiPS model provided distinct survival groups for patients in the three palliative care settings and those receiving chemotherapy. The PPI seems to be suitable for routine clinical use for situations where rough estimates of prognosis are sufficient and/or patients do not want invasive procedure. If clinicians can address more items, the modified PiPS-A would be a non-invasive alternative. In cases where blood samples are available or those requiring more accurate prediction, the PaP and D-PaP scores and modified PiPS-B would be more appropriate. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Oncogenic mutations in exon 2 of MED12 occur in nearly 70% of uterine leiomyomas, and together with HMGA, represent the most common genetic anomalies in leiomyoma. This mutational anomaly represents a driver mutation. MED12 mutations are restricted to benign smooth muscle tumours (leiomyomas) of the uterus or of the M\u00fcllerian system, but decreased protein expression has also been observed in uterine leiomyosarcomas independently of mutational status, suggesting a possible epigenetic mechanism. The discovery of MED12 involvement in leiomyoma genesis has dramatically contributed to increasing our knowledge on leiomyomas, but many questions remain. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge and perspectives on the role of MED12 in the genesis of uterine smooth muscle tumours. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Increasing evidence suggests that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitors might be effective in advanced SCCHN. However, non-invasive biomarkers for early prediction of treatment efficacy are not established in SCCHN. Highly proliferating tumours are characterised by enhanced cell turnover which is associated with enhanced apoptosis. During apoptosis of epithelial cells caspases cleave cytokeratin (CK)-18 can be detected in the blood. In this study we analysed sera from patients with relapsed or metastatic SCCHN patients who have been treated with temsirolimus for caspase-cleaved and total (caspase-cleaved and uncleaved) CK-18 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). In addition, caspase-3 activity was detected by luminometric substrate assay. SCCHN patients revealed higher serum levels of those biomarkers compared to healthy controls. Importantly, patients with short progression-free survival (PFS) showed higher serum levels of caspase-3 activity compared to patients with longer PFS (\u2a7e2months). Caspase-3 activity is inversely correlated with PFS. A cut-off value for caspase-3 activity was determined that correctly predicted PFS &lt;2months with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 67%. These data demonstrate that detection of serum caspase-3 activity might be a useful non-invasive biomarker for early identification of SCCHN patients not responding to treatment with novel targeted therapies such as mTOR-inhibitors. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Patients and methods Patients with advanced thyroid cancer that was refractory or not appropriate for 131I received dovitinib orally, 500mg once daily for five consecutive days, followed by a 2-day rest every week. The primary end-point was objective response rate. Secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, changes in tumour markers and safety.   Results Between January 2013 and October 2014, a total of 40 patients were enrolled. There were 23 (57.5%) papillary thyroid cancer, 12 (30%) medullary thyroid cancer and 5 (12.5%) follicular thyroid cancer patients. One patient had withdrawn consent before the administration of dovitinib. The overall response rate was 20.5% (8/39) and disease control rate was 69.1% (26/39). Median PFS was 5.4months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0\u20138.8) and median OS was not reached with 8.4months follow-up duration. Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (53.8%), anorexia (35.8%), vomiting (25.6%), fatigue (23%) and nausea (20.5%), most of which were grade 1 or 2.

Background Head-neck cancer treatment has become more intensified, comprising not only surgery and radiotherapy, but also induction/concomitant chemotherapy and targeted therapy. With less treatment, 3-year disease free survival (DFS) is 80% for HPV-positive TSCC and BOTSCC. An 85\u2013100% 3-year DFS is observed for HPV+ TSCC and BOTSCC with absence of HLA class I, or CD44 expression, or high CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts suggesting that therapy could be tapered for many if patients could be identified individually.   Patients and methods Patients treated curatively, with HPV DNA/p16INK4a positive tumours examined for HLA class I and II, CD44 and CD8+TILs, were included. An L1-regularised logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of the biomarker data, age, stage, diagnosis, smoking and treatment on 3-year risk of death or relapse on a training cohort of 197 patients diagnosed 2000\u20132007 and validated on a cohort of 118 patients diagnosed 2008\u20132011.

Maki<br>\n<br>\n Background Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) are often followed up after surgery with longitudinally repeated imaging examinations to detect recurrence early. Studies on follow-up of GIST patients are few, the optimal follow-up methods are unknown and the recommendations for follow-up vary in guidelines.   Methods We reviewed the current evidence for follow-up of patients treated with surgery alone and of patients who were treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant imatinib.   Results Imaging of the abdomen and the pelvis with computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually suffices, since metastases are uncommon at other sites. The frequency of imaging may be adjusted with the risk of recurrence with time. Very low risk GISTs are very frequently cured with surgery and usually require no regular follow-up after complete surgery, and annual CT of the abdomen and the pelvis for 5years suffices for most patients with a low to intermediate risk for recurrence. Most high-risk patients are treated with imatinib for at least 3years after surgery. CT or MRI may be carried out 6-monthly during adjuvant imatinib, 3 to 4-monthly during the 2years that follow discontinuation of imatinib when the risk of recurrence is high, and then at 6\u201312month intervals to complete 10years of follow-up. Recurrence after the first 10years of follow-up is infrequent.   Conclusions The follow-up schedules are best tailored with the risk of recurrence.

A substantial number of DCIS lesions will never form a health hazard, particularly if it concerns non- to slow-growing low-grade DCIS. The LORD study aims to evaluate the safety of active surveillance in women with low-risk DCIS.   Design This is a randomised, international multicentre, open-label, phase III non-inferiority trial, led by the Dutch Breast Cancer Research Group (BOOG 2014-04) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC-BCG 1401). Standard treatment will be compared to active surveillance in 1240 women aged \u2a7e45years with asymptomatic, screen-detected, pure low-grade DCIS based on vacuum-assisted biopsies of microcalcifications only. Both study arms will be monitored with annual digital mammography for a period of 10years. The primary end-point is 10-year ipsilateral invasive breast cancer free percentage. Secondary end-points include patient reported outcomes, diagnostic biopsy rate during follow-up, ipsilateral mastectomy rate and translational research.

By reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone, dutasteride (dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) could increase the effectiveness of bicalutamide in this setting. The objective of the study is therefore to prospectively evaluate dutasteride plus bicalutamide in men with asymptomatic, non-metastatic CRPC with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).   Methods Prostate cancer patients with rising PSA whilst on first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were randomised (1:1) in a double-blind trial to receive bicalutamide 50mg plus placebo or bicalutamide 50mg plus dutasteride 3.5mg once daily for 18months. Randomisation was stratified by centre; treatment assignments were generated using GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s RandAll System. Subjects who completed 18months could participate in the 2-year extension. Central laboratory and study sites/monitors remained treatment-blinded. Primary end-point was time to disease progression (TDP) up to 42months (defined as PSA progression from baseline or nadir, radiographic disease progression, death from prostate cancer or receipt of rescue medication).   Findings There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in 127 men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride (n =62) compared with bicalutamide/placebo (n =65) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61, 1.46]; p =0.79). The estimated median TDP was 425days (95% CI 302, 858) in the bicalutamide/placebo group and 623days (95% CI 369, 730) in the bicalutamide/dutasteride group. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for any secondary efficacy end-points, including time to treatment failure or PSA response. In the multivariate analysis, age, non-White race, higher baseline testosterone and lower baseline PSA were associated with longer TDP. Adverse events were comparable between treatment groups.   Interpretation In men with non-metastatic CRPC, adding dutasteride to bicalutamide did not significantly prolong TDP. Prospective data are provided concerning the common practice of using bicalutamide in this setting. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Lohneis<br>\n<br>\n Background High expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is considered to predict survival in patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer. A standard evaluation system for immunohistochemical analysis (antibody, scoring system) has not yet been established.   Methods CONKO-001, a prospective randomised phase III study investigated the role of adjuvant gemcitabine (gem) as compared to observation (obs). Tumour samples of 156 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry with the rabbit monoclonal antibody SP120 (Ventana Medical Systems) for expression of hENT1. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses for median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed in dependence of hENT1 expression measured analogously to Farrell et al. 2009 and Poplin et al. 2013.   Results For the 88 gem and 68 obs patients, median DFS/OS was 12.9/22.7months and 6.2/19.1months. High hENT1 expression was not associated with improved median DFS (Farrell: no hENT1 22.2months, low hENT1 13.7months, high hENT1 12.1months, p =0.248; Poplin: low hENT1 13.2months versus high hENT1 11.5months, p =0.5) or median OS (Farrell: no hENT1 21.7months, low hENT1 24.7months, high hENT1 19.5, p =0.571; Poplin: low hENT1 24.4months versus high hENT1 19.7months, p =0.92;) in the gem group or in the obs group (median DFS Farrell: no hENT1 5.1months, low hENT1 6.2months, high hENT1 7.5months, p =0.375; Poplin: low hENT1 6.2months versus high hENT1 5.9months, p =0.83; median OS Farrell: no hENT1 20.2months, low hENT1 17.7months, high HENT1 19.1months, p =0.738; Poplin: low hENT1 17.7months versus high hENT1 20.4months, p =0.65) measured by the Farrell or Poplin Score.   Conclusions We cannot confirm a predictive role of hENT1 measured by the clone SP120 rabbit antibody in our study population. Reproducible standard procedures are urgently needed prior to the implementation or exclusion of hENT1 as a predictive biomarker in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, all consecutive patients who underwent oesophageal resection with gastric interposition for cancer at a tertiary referral centre between January 2007 and July 2012 were included. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-OES18 were sent to all patients alive without recurrence more than 1year after surgery.   Results The questionnaires were completed by 92 of 100 patients. Median duration of follow-up after surgery at completing the questionnaire was 36months (range: 12\u201375). Global quality of life scores were similar to a general population reference group (76\u00b119 versus 78\u00b117; p =0.26). However, patients scored significantly worse compared to the general population reference group on physical-, role-, cognitive- and social functioning (p &lt;0.001). Neoadjuvant therapy and minimally invasive oesophagectomy were associated with significantly better health-related quality of life (HRQL) and symptom scores (p &lt;0.05).   Conclusion Global HRQL more than 1year after oesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction is comparable to the general Dutch background population, while specific functional and symptom scores are significantly worse.

We sought to determine the survival benefits that patients and their doctors judged sufficient to make ACT in NSCLC worthwhile.   Methods 122 patients completed a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 6months (before &amp; after ACT, if they had it); 82 doctors completed the questionnaire once only. The time trade-off method was used to determine the minimum survival benefits judged sufficient in four hypothetical scenarios. Baseline survival times were 3years &amp; 5years and baseline survival rates (at 5years) were 50% &amp; 65%.   Results At baseline, the median benefits judged sufficient by patients were an extra 9months (Interquartile range (IQR) 1\u201312months) beyond 3years &amp; 5years and an extra 5% (IQR 0.1\u201310%) beyond 50% &amp; 65%.

Pazopanib is an oral, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). EORTC 08092 evaluated pazopanib given as maintenance treatment following standard first line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.   Methods Patients with non-progressive disease after 4\u20136 cycles of chemotherapy were randomised to receive either pazopanib 800mg/day or matched placebo until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point was overall survival and secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.   Results A total of 600 patients were planned to be randomised. The trial was prematurely stopped following an early interim analysis, after 102 patients were randomised to pazopanib (n =50) or placebo (n =52). Median age was 64years in both arms. Median overall survival was 17.4months for pazopanib and 12.3months for placebo (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40\u20131.28]; p =0.257). Median PFS was 4.3months versus 3.2months (HR 0.67, [95% CI 0.43\u20131.03], p =0.068). PFS rates at 4months were 56% and 45% respectively. The majority of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were grade 1\u20132. Grade 3\u20134 AEs (pazopanib versus placebo) were hypertension (38% versus 8%), neutropenia (8% versus 0%), and elevated SGPT (6% versus 0%). Of the patients randomised to pazopanib, 22% withdrew due to a treatment-related AE.   Conclusions Switch maintenance with pazopanib following platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients had limited side-effects. This study was stopped due to lack of efficacy by stringent criteria for PFS at a futility interim analysis. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Yet infertility remains common following systemic treatment. To date, no study has evaluated the safety of assisted reproductive technology (ART) after breast cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated the impact of ART on pregnancy and long-term outcomes of young breast cancer survivors.   Methods This is a multi-centre retrospective study in which women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2009, and had a pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis were eligible. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether ART following primary systemic therapy was performed to achieve pregnancy. We evaluated the association between ART use and clinic-pathological characteristics, pregnancy outcome and long-term breast cancer outcome.   Results A total of 198 patients were evaluated; of whom 25 underwent ART. No significant differences in tumour characteristics were observed between both groups, except for histological grade 3 tumours, which were fewer in the ART group (36% versus 59%, p =0.033). Around 90% of patients received primary adjuvant chemotherapy and more than 50% had an endocrine sensitive disease. Patients in the ART group were older at diagnosis (31.4 versus 33.7years, p =0.009), at conception (38 versus 35years, p &lt;0.001), and experienced more miscarriages (23.5 versus 12.6%, p =0.082). Full term pregnancies were achieved in 77% and 76% of the spontaneous and ART groups, respectively. Mean follow-up between conception and last follow-up was 63 and 50months in the spontaneous and ART groups, respectively with no difference in breast cancer outcome observed between the two groups (p =0.54).   Conclusion Pregnancy using ART in women with history of breast cancer is feasible and does not seem to be detrimental to cancer outcome. Larger studies are needed to further confirm this observation. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Here, we present the 10-year final trial safety and efficacy analyses. We also report an exploratory analysis on the predictive value of Ki67 for docetaxel efficacy, in the BIG 2\u201398 and using a pooled analysis of three other randomised trials.   Patients and methods 2887 patients were randomly assigned in a 2\u00d72 trial design to one of four treatments. The primary objective was to evaluate the overall efficacy of docetaxel on disease free survival (DFS). Secondary objectives included comparisons of sequential docetaxel versus sequential control arm, safety and overall survival (OS). Ki67 expression was centrally evaluated by immunohistochemistry.   Results After a median follow-up of 10.1years, the addition of docetaxel did not significantly improve DFS or OS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.81\u20131.04; P =0.16 and HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.76\u20131.03; P =0.11, respectively). Sequential docetaxel did not improve DFS compared to the sequential control arm (HR=0.86, 95% CI=0.72\u20131.03; P =0.10). In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours with Ki67\u2a7e14%, the addition of docetaxel resulted in 5.4% improvement in 10-year OS (P =0.03, test for interaction=0.1). In a multivariate model, there was a trend for improved DFS and OS in ER-positive patients with high Ki67 and treated with docetaxel (HR=0.79, 95% CI=0.63\u20131.01; P =0.05 and HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.57\u20131.01; P =0.06, respectively). A pooled analysis of four randomised trials showed a benefit of taxanes in highly proliferative ER-positive disease but not in low proliferating tumours (interaction test P =0.01).   Conclusion The DFS benefit previously demonstrated with sequential docetaxel is no longer observed at 10years. However, an exploratory analysis suggested a benefit of docetaxel in patients with highly proliferative ER-positive BC. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

                "abstract": "Expression of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness and does not always correlate with HIF-1&alpha; expression. Presently, we analyzed the regulation of CA9 expression during hypoxia by HIF-1&alpha;, Notch3, and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in breast carcinoma cells. Both HIF-1&alpha; and Notch3 were absolutely required for the expression of CA9 mRNA, protein, and reporter. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of HIF-1&alpha;, Notch3 intracellular domain (NICD3), and pVHL demonstrated their association. The presence of common consensus prolyl hydroxylation and pVHL binding motifs (L(XY)LAP);LLPLAP2191 suggested an oxygen-dependent regulation for NICD3. However, unlike the HIF-1&alpha; protein, NICD3 protein levels were not modulated with hypoxia or hypoxia-mimetic agents. Surprisingly, mutations of the common prolyl hydroxylation and pVHL binding domain lead to the loss of CA9 mRNA, protein, and reporter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the association of NICD3, HIF-1&alpha;, and pVHL at the CA9 promoter. Further, the NICD3 mutant defective in prolyl hydroxylation and subsequent pVHL binding caused a reduction in cell proliferation of breast carcinoma cells. We show here for the first time that the interaction of HIF-1&alpha; with NICD3 is important for the regulation of CA9 expression. These findings suggest that although CA9 is a hypoxia-responsive gene, its expression is modulated by the interaction of HIF-1&alpha;, Notch3, and VHL proteins. Targeting the expression of CA9 by targeting upstream regulators could be useful in cancer/stem cell therapy.",

MAP3K1 regulates JNK activation and is unique among human kinases in that it also encodes an E3 ligase domain that ubiquitylates c-Jun and ERK1/2. Full length MAP3K1 regulates cell migration and contributes to pro-survival signaling while its caspase 3-mediated cleavage generates a C-terminal kinase domain that promotes apoptosis. The critical function of MAP3K1 in cell fate decisions suggests that it may be a target for deregulation in cancer. Recent large-scale genomic studies have revealed that MAP3K1 copy number loss and somatic missense or nonsense mutations are observed in a significant number of different cancers, being most prominent in luminal breast cancer. The alteration of MAP3K1 in diverse cancer types demonstrates the importance of defining phenotypes for possible therapeutic targeting of tumor cell vulnerabilities created when MAP3K1 function is lost or gained.",

                "abstract": "Ect2, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF), is atypical among RhoGEFs in its predominantly nuclear localization in interphase cells. One current model suggests that Ect2 mislocalization drives cellular transformation by promoting aberrant activation of cytoplasmic Rho family GTPase substrates. However, in ovarian cancers, where Ect2 is both amplified and overexpressed at the mRNA level, we observed that the protein is highly expressed and predominantly nuclear and that nuclear but not cytoplasmic Ect2 increases with advanced disease. Knockdown of Ect2 in ovarian cancer cell lines impaired their anchorage-independent growth without affecting their growth on plastic. Restoration of Ect2 expression rescued the anchorage-independent growth defect, but not if either the DH catalytic domain or the nuclear localization sequences of Ect2 were mutated. These results suggested a novel mechanism whereby Ect2 could drive transformation in ovarian cancer cells by acting as a RhoGEF specifically within the nucleus. Interestingly, Ect2 had an intrinsically distinct GTPase specificity profile in the nucleus versus the cytoplasm. Nuclear Ect2 bound preferentially to Rac1, while cytoplasmic Ect2 bound to RhoA but not Rac. Consistent with nuclear activation of endogenous Rac, Ect2 overexpression was sufficient to recruit Rac effectors to the nucleus, a process that required a functional Ect2 catalytic domain. Furthermore, expression of active nuclearly targeted Rac1 rescued the defect in transformed growth caused by Ect2 knockdown. Our work suggests a novel mechanism of Ect2-driven transformation, identifies subcellular localization as a regulator of GEF specificity, and implicates activation of nuclear Rac1 in cellular transformation.",

                "abstract": "Mutation or aberrant splicing can interrupt gene expression. Tumor suppressor Bax is one of the susceptible genes prone to microsatellite frameshifting mutations in coding regions. As a result, tumors exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI) often present a \"Bax-negative\" phenotype. We previously reported that some Bax-negative cells in fact contain a functional Bax isoform (Bax2), generated when unique alternative splicing \"salvages\" the shifted reading frame introduced by a microsatellite mutation. Here we compared Bax alternative splicing profiles in a range of cell lines and primary tumors with and without Bax microsatellite mutations. We found that MSI tumors exhibit a high Bax alternative splicing frequency, especially in exon 2, and produce a family of alternatively spliced isoforms that retain many important Bax functional domains. Surprisingly, these Bax2 family isoforms can rescue Bax from all common microsatellite frameshift mutations. Production of Bax2 requires specific cis mutations, while trans components are not cell-type specific. Furthermore, all Bax2 family isoforms are more potent cell death inducers than the parental Bax without directly targeting mitochondria. These results indicate that the Bax2 family can potentially salvage Bax tumor suppressor expression otherwise lost to mutation.",

                "abstract": "The vast majority of cancer-related deaths are attributable to metastasis. Effective treatment of metastatic disease will be improved by a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon. Much of the work in this field has focused on metastasis of carcinomas, tumors of epithelial origin, while metastasis of sarcomas, tumors of mesenchymal origin, remains poorly understood. Experimental evidence from studies in carcinomas, coupled with clinical observations, highlights the importance of both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics in these cancer cells that make them competent for metastasis. We set out to test if similar cellular plasticity contributes to sarcoma metastasis. We found that the transcription factor, ZEB2, repressed epithelial gene expression in Ewing sarcoma cells, and this, in turn, repressed the epithelial phenotype. When ZEB2 was experimentally reduced in these cells, epithelial characteristics including decreased migratory ability and cytoskeleton rearrangements were observed. Furthermore, ZEB2 reduction in Ewing sarcoma cells resulted in a decreased metastatic potential using a mouse metastasis model. Our data show that Ewing sarcoma cells may have more epithelial plasticity than previously appreciated. This coupled with previous data demonstrating Ewing sarcoma cells also have mesenchymal features primes these cells to successfully metastasize. This is clinically relevant for 2 important reasons.

Both intracellular and extracellular Nampt (iNampt and eNampt) levels are increased in several human malignancies and some studies demonstrate increased iNampt in more aggressive/invasive tumors and in tumor metastases. Several different molecular targets have been identified that promote carcinogenesis following iNampt overexpression, including SirT1, CtBP, and PARP-1. Additionally, eNampt is elevated in several human cancers and is often associated with a higher tumor stage and worse prognoses. Here we review the roles of Nampt in malignancy, some of the known mechanisms by which it promotes carcinogenesis, and discuss the possibility of employing Nampt inhibitors in cancer treatment.",

To determine the dependence of high-grade gliomas on this signaling pathway, we developed a doxycycline-regulated KRas glioma mouse model. Using this model we previously demonstrated that inhibition of KRas expression in gliomas induced by activated KRas and Akt results in complete tumor regression. We have also shown that, in the context of Ink4a/Arf loss, abrogation of KRas signaling is sufficient to decrease tumor burden but resistance ensues. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of activated Akt signaling in combination with activated KRas and loss of Ink4a/Arf on the growth and recurrence of brain tumors following suppression of KRas expression. We observed significant tumor formation in Ink4a/Arflox/lox<br>\n mice injected with retroviruses containing tetracycline responsive element (TRE)-KRas, Tet-off, Akt, and Cre. Abrogation of KRas signaling resulted in significant tumor regression; however, resistance developed after a relatively short latency. Tumor recurrence occurred more rapidly and the tumors were more aggressive in the presence of activated Akt signaling compared with loss of Ink4a/Arf alone suggesting that this pathway contributes to tumor progression in this context.",

Current therapeutic strategies include targeting of key signaling molecules using pharmacological inhibitors in combination with genotoxic agents such as temozolomide. In spite of all efforts, the prognosis of glioma patients remains dismal. Therefore, a proper understanding of individual molecular pathways responsible for the progression of GBM is necessary. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is probably the most significant signaling pathway clinically implicated in glioma. Not surprisingly, anti-EGFR therapies mostly prevail for therapeutic purposes. The Wnt/&beta;-catenin pathway is well implicated in multiple tumors; however, its role in glioma has only recently started to emerge. We give a concise account of the current understanding of the role of both these pathways in glioma. Last, taking evidences from a limited literature, we outline a number of points where these pathways intersect each other and put forward the possibility of combinatorially targeting them for treatment of glioma.",

Approaches to remove hypercalcemia and development of nonhypercalcemic agents can lead to the development of vitamin D&ndash;based therapies for treatment of various cancers. In this report, in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacy, safety, and details of vitamin D receptor (VDR) interactions of PT19c, a novel nonhypercalcemic vitamin D derived anticancer agent, are described. PT19c was synthesized by bromoacetylation of PTAD-ergocalciferol adduct. Broader growth inhibitory potential of PT19c was evaluated in a panel of chemoresistant breast, renal, ovarian, lung, colon, leukemia, prostate, melanoma, and central nervous system cancers cell line types of NCI60 cell line panel. Interactions of PT19c with VDR were determined by a VDR transactivation assay in a VDR overexpressing VDR-UAS-bla-HEK293 cells, in vitro VDR-coregulator binding, and molecular docking with VDR-ligand binding domain (VDR-LBD) in comparison with calcitriol. Acute toxicity of PT19c was determined in nontumored mice. In vivo antitumor efficacy of PT19c was determined via ovarian and endometrial cancer xenograft experiments. Effect of PT19c on actin filament organization and focal adhesion formation was examined by microscopy. PT19c treatment inhibited growth of chemoresistant NCI60 cell lines (log10GI50 ~ &ndash;4.05 to &ndash;6.73). PT19c (10 mg/kg, 35 days) reduced growth of ovarian and endometrial xenograft tumor without hypercalcemia. PT19c exerted no acute toxicity up to 400 mg/kg (QDx1) in animals. PT19c showed weak VDR antagonism, lack of VDR binding, and inverted spatial accommodation in VDR-LBD. PT19c caused actin filament dysfunction and inhibited focal adhesion in SKOV-3 cells. PT19c is a VDR independent nonhypercalcemic vitamin D&ndash;derived agent that showed noteworthy safety and efficacy in ovarian and endometrial cancer animal models and inhibited actin organization and focal adhesion in ovarian cancer cells.",

We performed mRNA expression analyses and survival correlations in glioblastoma patients. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of RNAi\u2010based silencing and overexpression of CMTM family genes on tumor cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. CMTMs appeared to be widely regulated in the group of glioblastomas relative to non\u2010neoplastic brain (NB) tissue (significant upregulation for CMTM2, 3, and 6 and significant downregulation for CMTM 4 and 8). For CMTM1, 5 and 7, we found aberrant expression levels in individual tumors. Functionally, CMTM1, 3, and 7 promoted tumor cell invasion, while CMTM1 additionally enhanced cell proliferation. In a large clinically annotated dataset, higher CMTM1 and 3 expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival. Our data thus suggest CMTM1 and 3 as priority targets in glioblastomas.

Recent studies have identified BRAF(V600E) mutations in most HCL patients, highlighting this abnormality as a molecular hallmark for this disease. Cell lines originating from HCL patients lack BRAF mutations but retain the typical piliferous morphology and the distinctive HCL immunophenotype, thus, constituting suitable tools for identifying alternative tumor genes and leukemic mechanisms in this malignancy. To this end, we integrated genomic and transcriptional profiling of the HCL cell line MLMA. The expression levels of genomically targeted genes were compared to four HCL control cell lines, thus, identifying 91 chromosomally deregulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis of these indicted apoptosis, proliferation, and DNA damage response as altered processes. Accordingly, prominent target genes overexpressed in this cell line include ATM, BRAF, CDK6, CUTL1/CUX1, H2AFX, and REL. Treatment of MLMA with selective pharmacological inhibitors and specific siRNA\u2010mediated gene knockdowns highlighted a central role for NFkB in their deregulation in HCL. Moreover, relevant expression profiling data from HCL and ABC\u2010DLBCL cell lines display elevated NFkB\u2010pathway activity when compared to GC\u2010DLBCL equivalents. Finally, analysis of HCL patient samples in silico collectively supported the clinical significance of NFkB activation in this disease.

Therefore, NFkB may represent a B\u2010cell specific hallmark of HCL and a promising novel therapeutic target, most notably in patients lacking BRAF mutations in this entity including variant HCL. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Using conventional Sanger sequencing, we profiled 39 cases of fibroepithelial breast tumors comprising classic histological subtypes of fibroadenomas as well as benign and malignant phyllodes tumors for mutations in exon 2 of MED12. MED12 mutations were detected in 60% of all tumor samples with the majority being missense mutations affecting codon 44.

Sixty\u2010two percent of the fibroadenomas harbored mutated MED12 with intracanalicular fibroadenomas being the most frequently mutated histological subtype (82%). Of note, 8/11 of benign phyllodes tumors had MED12 mutations while only 1/5 of malignant phyllodes tumors showed mutations in exon 2 of MED12. In conclusion, we confirm the frequent occurrence of MED12 mutations in fibroadenomas, provide evidence that most intracanalicular fibroadenomas closely resembling benign phyllodes as well as benign phyllodes tumors harbor MED12 mutations, and conclude that MED12 mutations in malignant phyllodes tumors appear to be relatively rare. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In order to establish a highly sensitive method that has the power to detect low levels of NF2 mutant alleles from blood samples of mosaic NF2 patients, we performed ultra deep sequencing and calculated the percentage of mutant and wildtype NF2 alleles. The mutant allele frequencies detected ranged from 2.6% to 19.7%.

Remarkably, we observed a correlation between the age at onset of the disease and the mutant allele frequency.

To date, five partner genes have been identified, that is, PRCC in 1q21, PSF in 1q34, ASPL in 17q25, CLTC in 17q23, and NONO in Xq12; and three additional translocations have been reported with no partner gene being defined: t(X;3)(p11;q23), t(X;10)(p11;q23), and t(X;19)(p11;q13). Here, we report the identification of a novel TFE3 fusion partner, PARP14 in chromosome band3q21. We used RNA\u2010seq on a 10\u2010year\u2010old FFPE (formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded) tissue sample, which carried t(X;3)(p11;q23) as detected in the original cytogenetic study. The fusion transcript connected the 5'\u2010end of the first two exons of PARP14 to the 3'\u2010end of five exons of TFE3, which was verified by reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Similar to other TFE3 fusions previously reported, the predicted PARP14\u2010TFE3 product retains the nuclear localization and DNA\u2010binding domains of TFE3. This finding expands the list of TFE3 translocation partner genes and re\u2010emphasizes the essential oncogenic role of TFE3 fusion proteins in this tumor. Our result also clearly demonstrated the feasibility of identifying chromosomal translocation by RNA\u2010seq in clinical FFPE, which are easily accessible and associated with valuable clinical information. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

                "abstract": "The proteasome ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 has been shown to be a driver for 20q13.3 amplification in epithelial cancers including ovarian and colon cancer. We performed array\u2010CGH on 16 gastric cancer cell lines and found 20q13.3 to be amplified in 19% with the minimal amplified region in gastric cancer cell line AGS spanning a 1 Mb region including ADRM1. Expression microarray analysis shows overexpression of only two genes in the minimal region, ADRM1 and OSBPL2. While RNAi knockdown of both ADRM1 and OSBPL2 led to a slight reduction in growth, only ADRM1 RNAi knockdown led to a significant reduction in migration and growth in soft\u2010agar. Treatment of AGS cells with the ADRM1 inhibitor RA190 resulted in proteasome inhibition, but RNAi knockdown of ADRM1 did not. However, RNAi knockdown of ADRM1 led to a significant reduction in specific proteins including MNAT1, HRS, and EGFR. We hypothesize that ADRM1 may act in ADRM1\u2010amplified gastric cancer to alter protein levels of specific oncogenes resulting in an increase in metastatic potential. Selective inhibition of ADRM1 independent of proteasome inhibition may result in a targeted therapy for ADRM1\u2010amplified gastric cancer. In vivo models are now warranted to validate these findings. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

                "abstract": "The pathways of NOTCH and PI3K/AKT are dysregulated in about 60% and 48% of T\u2010cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T\u2010ALL) patients, respectively. In this context, they interact and cooperate in controlling tumor cell biology. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which the PI3K/AKT pathway regulates NOTCH1 in T\u2010ALL, starting from the evidence that the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling induced by treatment with LY294002 or transient transfection with a dominant negative AKT mutant downregulates NOTCH1 protein levels and activity, without affecting NOTCH1 transcription. We showed that the withdrawal of PI3K/AKT signaling was associated to NOTCH1 phosphorylation in tyrosine residues and monoubiquitination of NOTCH1 detected by Ubiquitin capture assay. Co\u2010immunoprecipitation assay and colocalization analysis further showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c\u2010Cbl interacts and monoubiquitinates NOTCH1, activating its lysosomal degradation. These results suggest that the degradation of NOTCH1 could represent a mechanism of control by which NOTCH1 receptors are actively removed from the cell surface. This mechanism is finely regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway in physiological conditions. In pathological conditions characterized by PI3K/AKT hyperactivation, such as T\u2010ALL, the excessive AKT signaling could lead to NOTCH1 signaling dysregulation. Therefore, a therapeutic strategy directed to PI3K/AKT in T\u2010ALL could contemporaneously inhibit the dysregulated NOTCH1 signaling. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Therefore, many patients with cancer have turned to complementary therapies to help them with their physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Massage therapy is increasingly used for symptom relief in patients with cancer. The current study aimed to investigate by meta-analysis the effects of massage therapy for cancer patients experiencing pain. Nine electronic databases were systematically searched for studies published through August 2013 in English, Chinese, and Korean. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Cochrane risk-of-bias scales. Twelve studies, including 559 participants, were used in the meta-analysis. In 9 high-quality studies based on the PEDro scale (standardized mean difference, &ndash;1.24; 95% confidence interval, &ndash;1.72 to &ndash;0.75), we observed reduction in cancer pain after massage. Massage therapy significantly reduced cancer pain compared with no massage treatment or conventional care (standardized mean difference, &ndash;1.25; 95% confidence interval, &ndash;1.63 to &ndash;0.87). Our results indicate that massage is effective for the relief of cancer pain, especially for surgery-related pain. Among the various types of massage, foot reflexology appeared to be more effective than body or aroma massage. Our meta-analysis indicated a beneficial effect of massage for relief of cancer pain. Further well-designed, large studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to be able to draw firmer conclusions regarding the effectiveness.",

                "abstract": "Background. Health care policies and guidelines that are clear and consistent with research evidence are important for maximizing clinical outcomes. To determine whether cancer centers in Canada and the United States had policies and/or guidelines about antioxidant use, and whether policies were aligned with the evidence base, we reviewed current research evidence in the field, and we undertook a survey of the policies and guidelines on antioxidant use at cancer institutions across North America. Methods. A survey of policies and guidelines on antioxidant use and the development and communication of the policies and guidelines was conducted by contacting cancer institutions in North America. We also conducted a Website search for each institution to explore any online resources. Results. Policies and guidelines on antioxidant use were collected from 78 cancer institutions. Few cancer institutions had policies (5%) but most provided guidelines (69%). Antioxidants from diet were generally encouraged at cancer institutions, consistent with the current research evidence. In contrast, specific antioxidant supplements were generally not recommended at cancer institutions. Policies and guidelines were developed using evidence-based methods (53%), by consulting another source (35%), or through discussions/conference (26%), and communicated mainly through online resources (65%) or written handouts (42%). For cancer institutions that had no policy or guideline on antioxidants, lack of information and lack of time were the most frequently cited reasons. Conclusions. Policies and guidelines on antioxidants from diet were largely consistent with the research evidence. Policies and guidelines on antioxidant supplements during treatment were generally more restrictive than the research evidence might suggest, perhaps due to the specificity of results and the inability to generalize findings across antioxidants, adding to the complexity of their optimal and safe use. Improved communication of comprehensive research evidence to cancer institutions may aid in the development of more evidence-based policies and guidelines.",

                "abstract": "Cancer pain management is a challenge for which Chinese herbal medicine might be useful. To study the spinal mechanisms of the Chinese medicated gel Long-Teng-Tong-Luo (LTTL), a 7-herb compound, on bone cancer pain, a bone cancer pain model was made by inoculating the tibias of female rats with Walker 256 cells. LTTL gel or inert gel, 0.5 g/cm2/d, was applied to the skin of tumor-bearing tibias for 21 days beginning a day after the inoculation. Mechanical threshold and paw withdrawal latency to thermal stimulation was measured. Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were immunostained and counted, and lumbar spinal cord interleukin-17A (IL-17A) was measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TRP antagonists and interleukin (IL)-17A antibodies were intrathecally administered to determine their effects on bone cancer pain. The gel significantly (P < .05) alleviated cancer-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and inhibited cancer-enhanced expression of IL-17A in spinal astrocytes and the TRP subfamily members V1, A1, and V4 in lumbar DRG. Intrathecal TRP antagonists at 10 &micro;g significantly (P < .05) attenuated mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and IL-17A expression, indicating that TRP channels facilitate spinal IL-17 expression and cancer pain. IL-17A antibodies inhibited cancer pain, suggesting that IL-17A promotes such pain. The data show that LTTL gel inhibits cancer pain, and this might be accounted for by the decrease in expression of DRG TRP channels and spinal astrocyte IL-17A.",

                "abstract": "Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life (QOL) and well-being. As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes in health outcomes in cancer survivors. In this exploratory study, which comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind&ndash;body interventions, mind&ndash;body bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance. Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once per week for 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up. In this cancer survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable across the 3 time points, of about 3 months&rsquo; duration, and mean baseline sOT levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age. Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being. Regarding intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE. In this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group compared with those in SHE. The findings in this exploratory study suggest that sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into the effects of mind&ndash;body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.",

The cancer toll on Indigenous Australians is alarming with overall cancer incidence and mortality rates higher and the 5-year survival rate lower for Indigenous Australians compared with non-Indigenous Australians. Meanwhile, a range of approaches to health and illness&mdash;including both complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and traditional Indigenous medicine (TM)&mdash;are used by cancer patients. Little work has focused on Indigenous cancer patients with regard to CAM/TM use. This article reports findings from the first examination of the prevalence and profile of TM/CAM use and users among Indigenous Australians with cancer. Methods. A structured questionnaire was administered via face-to-face interviews to 248 Indigenous Australian cancer patients diagnosed with a range of cancer types. All received treatment and were recruited from 1 of 4 large hospitals located in Queensland, Australia. Results. A substantial percentage (18.7%) of Indigenous cancer patients use at least one TM/CAM for support with their care, including traditional Indigenous therapy use (2.8%), visiting a traditional Indigenous practitioner (2.8%), CAM use (10.7%), visiting a CAM practitioner (2.4%), and attending relaxation/meditation classes (4.0%). Having a higher level of educational attainment was positively associated with CAM practitioner consultations (P = .015). Women with breast cancer were more likely to attend relaxation/meditation classes (P = .019). Men with genital organ cancer were more likely to use traditional Indigenous therapies (P = .017) and/or CAM (P = .002). Conclusion. A substantial percentage of Indigenous Australians reported using TM/CAM for their cancer care, and there is a need to expand examination of this area of health care using large-scale studies focusing on in-depth specific cancer(s).",

This study aimed to investigate the trends and regional variations in CAM use by cancer patients at a regional cancer care center in Toowoomba, South East Queensland, Australia. Methods. All English-speaking adult cancer patients attending the regional cancer care center were invited to participate. Eligible patients were provided a self-administered questionnaire that was developed based on published surveys. Ethics approval was obtained. Results. Overall 142 patients completed the questionnaire and 68% were currently or had previously used at least one form of CAM. CAM users and nonusers did not differ significantly by region, age, gender, time since diagnosis, income, town size, treatment intent, or metastases. CAM users were more likely to have a higher level of education. Concurrent CAM use with conventional treatment was reported by approximately half of respondents. The most common reason for CAM use was \"to improve general physical well-being.\" The most common sources of CAM information were family (31%) and friends (29%). Disclosure of CAM use to either the general practitioner or specialist was reported by 46% and 33% of patients, respectively. The most common reason for nondisclosure was \"doctor never asked.\" Conclusion. This study supports previous research that CAM use is as common in regional and remote areas as metropolitan areas. Nondisclosure of CAM use to health professionals was common. Future research needs to focus on strategies to improve communication between patients and health professionals about the use of CAM.",

                "abstract": "Introduction. Patients with advanced-stage lung cancer face poor survival and experience co-occurring chronic physical and psychosocial symptoms. Despite several years of research in exercise oncology, few exercise studies have targeted advanced lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the benefits of a 6-week supervised group exercise intervention and to outline the effect on aerobic capacity, strength, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and depression. Methods. VO2peak was assessed using an incremental exercise test. Muscle strength was measured with one repetition maximum test (1RM). HRQoL, anxiety, and depression were assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&ndash;Lung (FACT-L) scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results. One hundred and forthteen patients with advanced stage lung cancer were recruited. Forty-three patients dropped out. No serious adverse events were reported. Exercise adherence in the group training was 68%. Improvements in VO2peak (P < .001) and 6-minute walk distance (P < .001) and muscle strength measurements (P < .05) were seen. There was a reduction in anxiety level (P = .0007) and improvement in the emotional well-being parameter (FACT-L) but no statistically significant changes in HRQoL were observed. Conclusion. The results of the present study show that during a 6-week hospital-based supervised, structured, and group-based exercise program, patients with advanced-stage lung cancer (NSCLC IIIb-IV, ED-SCLC) improve their physical capacity (VO2peak, 1RM), functional capacity, anxiety level, and emotional well-being, but not their overall HRQoL. A randomized controlled trial testing the intervention including 216 patients is currently being carried out.",

Many cancer survivors continue to experience ongoing symptoms, such as fatigue and cognitive impairment, which are poorly managed and have few effective, evidence-based treatment options. Neurofeedback is a noninvasive, drug-free form of brain training that may alleviate long-term symptoms reported by cancer patients. Objective. The purpose of this systematic review of the literature was to describe the effectiveness and safety of neurofeedback for managing fatigue and cognitive impairment. Methods. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. A comprehensive search of 5 databases was conducted: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, PsycInfo, and Embase. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, cohort, case control studies, and descriptive studies were included in this review. Results. Twenty-seven relevant studies were included in the critical appraisals. The quality of most studies was poor to moderate based on the JBI critical appraisal checklists. Seventeen studies were deemed of sufficient quality to be included in the review: 10 experimental studies and 7 descriptive studies. Of these, only 2 were rated as high-quality studies and the remaining were rated as moderate quality. All 17 included studies reported positive results for at least one fatigue or cognitive outcome in a variety of populations, including 1 study with breast cancer survivors. Neurofeedback interventions were well tolerated with only 3 studies reporting any side effects. Conclusions. Despite issues with methodological quality, the overall positive findings and few reported side effects suggest neurofeedback could be helpful in alleviating fatigue and cognitive impairment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence that neurofeedback is an effective therapy for management of these symptoms in cancer survivors, however, these promising results support the need for further research with this patient population. More information about which neurofeedback technologies, approaches, and protocols could be successfully used with cancer survivors and with minimal side effects is needed. This research will have significance to nurses and physicians in oncology and primary care settings who provide follow-up care and counseling to cancer survivors experiencing debilitating symptoms in order to provide information and education related to evidence-based therapy options.",

We evaluated the effects of total alkaloids of Rubus alceifolius Poir (TARAP) on the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and furthermore investigated the possible molecular mechanisms mediating its anticancer activity. Methods. We implanted nude mice with human HCC HepG2 cells and fed them with vehicle (physiological saline) or 3 g/kg/day dose of TARAP 5 days per week for 21 days. We determined the in vitro effect of TARAP on the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells by transwell assay. We evaluated SHH signaling components&rsquo; (SHH, PTCH, SMO, and Gli1) expression levels by reverse transcriptase&ndash;polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Activity of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in supernatants was analyzed by zymography. The expression of the MMPs and their specific tissue inhibitor (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1, 2) in HCC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results. We discovered that TARAP inhibited hepatocellular migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, TARAP decreased the expression of SHH, PTCH, SMO, and Gli1 in HCC mouse tumors at both transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, TARAP inhibited the activity of MMP2 and MMP9. We found that TARAP reduced the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, as well as the tissue inhibitor of MMPs. Conclusion. Our study showed that TARAP inhibits HCC migration and invasion likely through suppression of the hedgehog pathway. This may, in part, explain its anticancer properties. These results suggest that total alkaloids in Rubus alceifolius may have potential as a novel antimetastasis drug in the treatment of HCC.",

They were randomly divided into two groups \"control\" and \"case\" individually 25 members. The group case, were treated for three months with oral contraceptive pills. Women were examined in sonography before and after taking pills in order to measure the polyp size. Almost 24% of the group case responded to treatment, 32% size reduction and 44% remained with no change in size. While, in the control group there was 28% size reduction, 37% neutral and 35% encountered increase in size was unchanged. The average size of endometrial polyps in the group control did not take statistical significance difference before and later than treatment (9.5 vs. 8.6 mm, p = 0.297). However, the size of the polyp in the group case had significant statistical difference before and after the treatment (9.5 vs. 6.3 mm, p<0.05). Use of oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of endometrial polyps is low cost and non-invasive compared with such surgical procedures as curettage and hysteroscopy. Therefore, in this regard, further studies are recommended.",

Methods: Serum SCCAg levels were retrospectively reviewed in patients previously treated for cervical squamous cell carcinoma, who had suspected recurrence of cervical cancer and who had undergone FDG PET/CT scans. The clinical impact of elevated SCCAg (>1.5 ng/ml) and negative SCCAg (\u22641.5 ng/ml) levels were analyzed based on the results of PET/CT and final diagnosis. Results: The overall patient-based sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of PET/CT for the detection of tumor recurrence or malignancy were 100% (86/86), 80.8% (21/26), 95.5% (107/112), 94.5% (86/91) and 100% (21/21), respectively. Of the 112 patients included in this study, recurrence or malignancy was detected by PET/CT in 62 of the 64 patients with elevated SCCAg, compared to 24 of the 48 patients with negative SCCAg levels. The overall patient-based PPV, NPV, sensitivity and accuracy of SCCAg for the detection of tumor recurrence or malignancy were 96.9% (62/64), 50% (24/48), 72.1% (62/86) and 76.8% (86/112), respectively. The five false-positive PET/CT results were all associated with patients with negative SCCAg levels. The PPV of positive PET/CT-associated elevated SCCAg for the detection of tumor recurrence or malignancy was 100% (62/62). The NPV of negative SCCAg-associated negative PET/CT was 100% (19/19). Conclusions: Serum SCCAg evaluation and FDG PET/CT imaging can be complementary techniques in cases of suspected recurrent cervical squamous cancer. Positive PET/CT with elevated SCCAg can predict recurrence. Although PET/CT cannot confidently be deferred due to a negative SCCAg test, the possibility of a false-positive PET/CT in those cases may have diagnostic importance.",

                "abstract": "Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is a human leukocyte surface molecule that is enriched on the surface of many cancer cells, and it plays an important role in proliferation and metastasis. In this study, we utilized the chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5/F35 carrying gene encoding scFv against EMMPRIN (scFv-M6-1B9) to down-regulate EMMPRIN cell surface expression and investigated programmed cell death response in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell, Caco-2. The scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody exhibits robust activity in reducing EMMPRIN cell surface expression. This approach led to the inducing of apoptosis, which was relative to the increasing of apoptotic bodies in sub-G1 peak, phosphatidylserine externalization, as well as TUNEL-positive cells. In addition, real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis indicated that apoptosis was enhanced through the mitochondrial pathway, a marked reduction of Bcl-2, leading to the translocation of cytochrome c and also the dramatic activation of caspase-3. Moreover, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker for CRC, was found to have significantly diminished in both secreted protein and mRNA levels. In conclusion, these findings suggest that EMMPRIN down-regulation by scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody has great potential in enhancing the efficacy of apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial pathway and in effecting a decline in the CEA level. Thus, its benefits could be applied to project the future prospects for targeted gene therapy and therapeutic application in monitoring colorectal cancer.",

Furthermore, somatostatin (SST) receptors (SSTR1, 2A and B, 3, 4 and 5) belong to the G protein coupled receptor family and are overexpressed in tumors. Since, human small-cell lung cancer overexpresses somatostatin receptors (STTR), they could be legitimate targets for treating SCLC.The aim of this study was the evaluation of cytotoxicity of somatostatin in combination with several anticancer drugs in HTB-175 cell line (Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell line that expresses neuron specific enolase).<br>\n<br>\n Methods: Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Cisplatin, Etoposide, Gemzar, Navelbine, Fluorouracil, Farmorubicin are the chemotherapeutic drugs that we used for the combination before and after adding somatostatin in SCLC cell culture. HTB-175 cell line was purchased from ATCC LGC Standards.At indicated time-point, 48h after the combination, cell viability and apoptosis were measured with Annexin V staining by flow cytometry.<br>\n<br>\nResults: Flow cytometry showed that Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Gemzar and Cisplatin induced apoptosis more when they were added before somatostatin, whereas etoposide induced apoptosis more after somatostatin treatment. Navelbine alone or in combination with somatostatin showed no differences in apoptosis. Farmorubicin showed equal toxicity in all combinations. Fluorouracil and Carboplatin induced apoptosis more when added alone in HTB-175 cell line. However, increased apoptosis was also observed when Carboplatin was administered before somatostatin in higher concentrations.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion: Our results indicated that depending on the drug, somatostatin treatment before or after chemotherapeutic drugs increased apoptosis in small cell lung cancer cells. We suggest that long acting somatostatin analogues could be used as additive and maintenance therapy in combination to antineoplastic agents in SCLC patients.",

This study was therefore performed to investigate the effects of KCa3.1 potassium channel blocker on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of human hepatocellular cancer cells HepG2. KCa3.1 mRNA and protein were detected in HepG2. Furthermore, KCa3.1 potassium channel blocker TRAM-34 was capable to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, which can be partially attenuated by 1-EBIO, an activator of KCa3.1 channel. Moreover, the migration of HepG2 was obviously inhibited by TRAM-34. Consistently, knockdown of KCa3.1 channel using its siRNA was also able to induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation and migration of HepG2. Meanwhile, intracellular ROS level was found augmented in HepG2 treated with TRAM-34. More importantly, p53 protein was found translocation from the cytoplasm into the nuclei of HepG2. Collectively, inhibition of KCa3.1 channel suppressed the growth and migration, and promoted the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating intracellular ROS level and promoting p53 activation.

Although, in an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis, the total miRNA expression profile could not generate a tree with clear distinction between pathologic complete response (pCR) and non-pCR classes, we found that elevated expression of miR-125b and miR-141 was associated with non-pCR.

                "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies and is rarely cured in the recurrent setting, mainly because of progressive chemoresistance, especially platinum resistance. In our previous studies, the platinum-resistance-related protein, annexin A3, was selected by comparative proteomics. In this study, we detected serum annexin A3 levels using a self-developed chemiluminescence immunoassay kit in a prospective EOC patient cohort. We also evaluated the capacity of serum annexin A3 levels to predict platinum resistance. Serum annexin A3 levels in healthy women exhibited a similar normal distribution (Z=0.723, P=0.673), allowing determination of a normal cutoff level of 0.11-1.45 ng/mL. Of the 89 EOC patients, 21 were platinum resistant and 68 were platinum sensitive. Residual disease after primary surgery (p=0.004) and serum annexin A3 levels (p=0.036) were both independent factors associated with platinum resistance. The AUC was 0.733 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.627-0.823). The optimal cutoff value for serum annexin A3 levels was 2.05 ng/mL. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that expression of annexin A3 as assessed by immunohistochemistry (P=0.005) and residual tumor size (P=0.000) had a significant influence on platinum resistance. The AUC of ROC curve of annexin A3 expression by immunohistochemistry was 0.664 (95% CI, 0.554-0.763) and the cut off value was \u201c>=moderate scores\u201d. In conclusion, we demonstrate that annexin A3 is a secreted protein that may be measured in the peripheral blood using a self-developed, chemiluminescence immunoassay kit.

However, the functional role of HAX-1 in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the expression of HAX-1 in cSCC and its relationship with the development of cSCC. HAX-1 expression in cSCC tissues and in-vitro cell models were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry. And the RNAi strategy was used to observe the relationship of HAX-1 and cSCC in A431 cells. The mRNA and protein level of HAX-1 were significantly higher in cSCC compared with normal tissue. There were significant differences in thickness (P=0.014), differentiation (P=0.027) and TNM stages (P=0.007). After knockdown the expression of HAX-1 by siRNA, the proliferation and the motility of A431 cell was inhibited obviously, and the apoptosis of A431 cells were induced too. HAX-1 may be a risk factor for patients with cSCC. As a potential tumor promoter in cSCC, HAX-1 may be a novel potential therapeutic target for cSCC treatment and deserves further investigation.",

We investigated the implication of female hormones and several cytokines in osteoarthropathy complicated with aromatase inhibitor treatment, and the efficacy of vitamin E on the severity of osteoarthropathy, in breast cancer patients.<br>\n<br>\nMethods: Sixty two breast cancer patients treated with aromatase inhibitor for average of 1.77 years were included. These patients were orally administered vitamin E (150mg/day) for 29.8 days to alleviate aromatase inhibitor-related osteoarthropathy. Severity of osteoarthropathy was scored, and the patients were grouped based on the severity or vitamin E efficacy. Serum estradiol, progesterone, vitamin E, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A concentrations were measured by ELISA or beads array procedures followed by flow cytometry.<br>\n<br>\nResults: There was no significant difference in serum concentrations of the biomarkers between the severe and the mild osteoarthropathy groups before vitamin E administration. The osteoarthropathy scores significantly decreased after vitamin E administration (p=0.0243), while serum-estradiol concentrations did not change. The serum-estradiol concentrations before vitamin E administration in the group sensitive to the vitamin E efficacy were significantly lower, as compared with those in the insensitive group (p=0.0005). The rate of the highly sensitive patients to the vitamin E efficacy in those exhibiting low serum-estradiol concentrations was significantly higher than that in the high serum-estradiol group (p=0.0004). In the sensitive group, serum-estradiol concentrations after taking vitamin E were significantly higher than those before taking vitamin E (p=0.0124).<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: Vitamin E administration seemed to be a potential way for relieving osteoarthropathy complicated with aromatase inhibitor use.

Patients' ages were compared, and the optimal cut-offs of the standard uptake value (SUV) ratio (tumor-to-non-tumor ratio of the SUV), as well as areas under the curves (AUC), were evaluated in terms of malignant and benign lesions in each age group by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Based on optimal cut-offs, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy were calculated, and the diagnostic accordance rate was compared between each age group and all patients, supported by 18FDG PET/CT imaging data.<br>\n<br>\nResults: There was a significant age difference between the malignant and benign groups (t=3.905 p=0.0001). ROC analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value in all patients, younger group, middle-aged group and elderly group was 1.25, 1.17, 1.45 and 1.25 for SUVratio, and 0.856, 0.962, 0.650, 0.973 for AUC. The chi-square test proved that diagnostic accordance rate of 18FDG PET/CT in younger group and elderly group were superior to that in all patients (\u03c72=13.352, P=0.0003) and (\u03c72=8.494, P=0.0036).

In addition, the diagnostic performance of SUVratio was better in younger and elderly groups than that in all patients, and was poorer in middle-aged group than that in all patients. Therefore, age difference appears to be one of the important factors for discriminating malignant liver lesions from benign ones using 18 FDG PET/CT.",

Cancer cells that overexpress telomerase are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. This study aimed to determine the effects of mitochondrial translocation of telomerase on MDR in HCC cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with negative plasmid and PTPN11 (Shp-2) short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) plasmid to establish HepG2-negative (HepG2 transfected with negative plasmid) and HepG2-ShShp-2 (HepG2 transfected with Shp-2 ShRNA plasmid) cells. Sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. Distribution of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) within mitochondria was detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was demonstrated by flow cytometry with the mitochondrial superoxide (Mito-Sox) indicator. The frequency of damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was illustrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex subunits ND1 and COXII were also demonstrated by western blotting. Knockdown of Shp-2 in HepG2 cells resulted in upregulation of mitochondrial TERT expression and increased resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (resistance indices, 2.094 and 1.863, respectively). In addition, both the mitochondrial ROS and the frequency of mtDNA damage were decreased, and COXII expression was upregulated. Our results suggest that Mitochondrial translocation of hTERT may lead to chemotherapeutic resistance in HCC cells. Mitochondrial hTERT contributes to the drug resistance of tumor cells by reducing ROS production and mtDNA damage, and exerting a protective effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain.",

                "abstract": "The immune/ inflammation system potentially serves to arrest, eliminate or promote tumor development. Nonetheless, factors that dictate the choice are not comprehensively known yet. Using a B16/F1 syngeneic wild type model, we evaluated the essentiality of initial transformed cells' density for overt tumor development, the molecular trends of inflammatory mediators in the normal tumor-adjacent epithelial tissues (NTAT), and how such local events may reflect systematically in the host. Overt tumors developed, within an observatory period of at least 45 days and 90 days at most, only in mice inoculated with cancer cells above a limiting threshold of 1\u00d7 103 cells. Immunoblots showed early, intense and transient presence of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and both the all-thiol and disulfide forms of HMGB1 in the NTAT of non-tumor bearing mice. However, all-thiol form of HMGB1 and delayed but aberrant IL-6 expression characterized chronic inflammation in tumor bearing hosts. These local epithelial tissue events uniquely reflected in host's systemic cytokines dynamics where stable Th1/Th2 signature (IFN-\u03b3/ IL-4) coupled with early Th1 cells polarization (IL-12/ IL-4) evidenced in non-tumor hosts but highly fluctuating Th1/ Th2 profile in tumor hosts, even before tumors became overt. This hypothesizes that the physical quantum of transformed cells that may either spontaneously arise or accrue at a locus may be crucial in orchestrating the mechanism for the type of local epithelial tissue and systemic immune/ inflammatory responses essential for tumor progression or arrest.",

For the 3 groups, incision length was 1.25 cm longer for the HALG group than for the LAG group but was significantly shorter for the HALG group than for the OG group (P =0.00). The rate of conversion to laparotomy , the pneumoperitoneum time and the number of recovered lymph nodes were significantly better for the HALG group than for the LAG group (P <0.05). The pain score at day 2 after surgery, intestinal function recovery time, and duration of postoperative hospital stay were not significantly different for the HALG and LAG groups ( P >0.05) but were significantly better for the HALG group than for the OG group (P <0.05).

However, no systematic analysis of suitable references in lncRNA studies in human glioma has been performed yet.<br>\n<br>\nMethods: In this study, we investigated 90 lncRNAs in 30 tissue specimen for the expression stability in human diffuse astrocytoma (WHO-Grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO-Grade III) and glioblastoma (WHO-Grade IV) both alone as well as in comparison with normal white matter. Our identification procedure included a rigorous bioinformatical selection process that resulted in the inclusion of only highly abundant, equally expressed lncRNAs for further analysis. Additionally, lncRNAs were classified according to their stability value using the NormFinder algorithm.<br>\n<br>\nResults: We identified 24 appropriate normalisers suitable for studies in diffuse astrocytoma, 22 for studies in anaplastic astrocytoma and 12 for studies in glioblastoma.

In addition, we found that inhibition of fibrin formation with the thrombin inhibitor hirudin in nude mice in vivo significantly reduced the metastatic outgrowth of kidney tumor cells. Colony formation was significantly more efficient in tumor cells embedded in fibrin compared to matrigel and this effect correlates with the capacity of tumor cells to assemble a fibronectin matrix and generate stress fibers. Interestingly, stress fiber formation in fibrin was a specific function of metastatic kidney tumor cells while non-metastatic cells remained round. Inhibition of stress fiber formation with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, in turn, reduced fibronectin matrix assembly and colony formation in fibrin suggesting that spreading is a critical mechanism for the outgrowth of metastatic kidney tumor cells. Overall, our results indicate that adhesive interactions with fibrin play an important role for the progression of renal cell carcinoma and that inhibiting these interactions could be a promising strategy for treatment and prevention of kidney cancer metastasis.",

Recently we have retrospectively confirmed this suggestion, therefore we have hypothesized that the mutational status of KRAS could influence the expression of ERCC1, one of the main mechanisms of Oxa resistance.<br>\n<br>\nMaterial and Methods: We used four cell lines of colorectal cancer: two KRAS wild type (wt) (HCT-8 and HT-29) and two KRAS mt (SW620 and SW480). We evaluated the sensitivity of these cell lines to Oxa by MTT-test as well the ERCC1 levels before and after 24 h exposure to Oxa by Real-Time PCR. We silenced KRAS in a KRAS mt cell line (SW620LV) to evaluate the impact on Oxa sensitivity and ERCC1 levels. Lastly, ERCC1 was also silenced in order to confirm the importance of this protein as an Oxa resistance factor.<br>\n<br>\nResults: The KRAS mt cell lines resulted more sensitive to Oxa (OR 2.68; IC 95% 1.511-4.757 p<0.001). The basal levels of ERCC1 did not show significant differences between KRAS mt and wt cell lines, however, after 24 h exposure to Oxa, only the wt KRAS lines showed the ability to induce ERCC1, with a statistically significant difference (OR 42.9 IC 95% 17.260-106.972 p<0.0005). By silencing KRAS, sensitivity to Oxa was reduced in mt KRAS cell lines and this effect was associated with the acquisition of ability to induce ERCC1. Silencing of ERCC1, in turn, enhanced the sensitivity to Oxa in wt KRAS cell lines and restored sensitivity to Oxa in SW620LV cell line.<br>\n<br>\nConclusion: KRAS mutated cell lines were more sensitive to Oxa. This feature seems secondary to the inability of these cells to induce ERCC1 after exposure to Oxa. Thus, KRAS mutational status might be a predictor of response to Oxa in CRC surrogating the cell ability to induce ERCC1.",

Results were compared with skeletal fracture pattern previously reported for a general population.<br>\nResults: Skeletal fractures in cancer patients occur throughout the entire skeleton similar to general population. The most common sites were vertebrae (16%), feet and toes (15%), ribs (12%), hands and fingers (10%), and pelvis (8%). Fracture incidence was observed starting within the first year of survivorship, and continued to after five years. The median time from cancer diagnosis to fracture varied by age (p<0.01), from a high of 3.2 years for ages 50-59 to a low of 1.2 years for patients older than 70.<br>\nConclusion: The pattern of skeletal fracture is similar between cancer survivor and general population. Contrary to general assumption, survivors can experience skeletal fracture early after cancer treatment, especially at an older age. Thus, cancer survivorship care should include assessment of early time points with improved management of cancer treatment related bone injury.",

To the best of our knowledge, the criterion of two target lesions per organ in the RECIST 1.1 is arbitrary and has not been supported by any objective evidence. Recently, we reported that the modified RECIST 1.1 (measuring the single largest lesion in each organ) showed a high level of concordance with the original RECIST 1.1 in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer (GC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, each study had a major limitation of a small number of patients.<br>\n<br>\nMethods: We conducted a pooled analysis using the data from the three individual studies to improve statistical power. Tumor responses were compared according to the RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST 1.1 (mRECIST 1.1).<br>\n<br>\nResults: A total of 153 patients who had at least two target lesions in any organ according to the RECIST 1.1 were included in this pooled study: 64 with NSCLC, 51 with GC, and 38 with CRC. Regardless of primary sites, the number of target lesions according to the mRECIST 1.1 was significantly lower than that according to the RECIST 1.1 (P<0.001). The assessment of tumor responses showed a high concordance between the two criteria (k = 0.908). Only eight patients (5.2%) showed disagreement in the tumor response assessment between the two criteria. The overall response rates of chemotherapy were not significantly different between the two criteria (33.3% versus 33.3%, P=1.0).<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: The modified RECIST 1.1 was comparable to the original RECIST 1.1 in the tumor response assessment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, GC, and CRC.

The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of brain and CNS cancer using data from the population-based cancer registry of Navarre, (Spain) during the period 1973-2008 and provide forecast figures up to-2014. Crude and age-standardized (world population) incidence rates of brain cancer per 100,000 person-years were calculated by the direct method separately by gender, area (Pamplona and others), and age-groups. Penalized splines for smoothing rates in the temporal dimensions were applied in order to estimate and forecast cancer incidence rates. Age-adjusted incidence rates showed an increase over the study and forecast periods in both sexes more marked in women than in men. Higher incidence rates were observed in men compared with women but the differences became smaller with time. The increase was due to the rise of rates in the oldest age groups since the rates for younger age groups remained stable or decreased over time. As the entire aetiology of brain and other CNS cancer is not still clear, keep promoting healthful lifestyles for cancer primary prevention among the whole population is necessary.",

After acclimatization for a week, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 15) and fed either KRG (0.5, 1 or 2%) or control diets for 10 weeks. After two weeks of starting of experimental diets, the rats were initiated hepatocarcinogenesis by injection of DEN and were then subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy at five-week for developing the medium-term bioassay system. Both 0.5 and 1% KRG diets suppressed the area (55 and 60%; p= 0.0251 and 0.0144) and number (39 and 59%; p= 0.0433 and 0.0012) of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci when compared to the DEN-control group. The production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was significantly reduced in 0.5 and 1% KRG-treated rats. The supplementation of 1% KRG diet significantly elevated the levels of total glutathione (tGSH) and glutathione-related enzymes including cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. It was also observed in cDNA microarray that the gene expressions (Cyp2c6, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a9, and Mgst1) involved in the xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome P450 signaling pathway were down-regulated in the 1% KRG diet-treated group when compared to the DEN-control. The chemopreventive effects of KRG could be affected by 1) the decrease of lipid peroxidation, 2) the increase of tGSH content and GSH-dependent enzyme activities, and 3) the decrease of the gene expression profile involved in cytochrome P450 signaling pathway. These results suggest that KRG may prove to be a therapeutic agent against hepatocarcinogenesis.",

                "abstract": "Summary: Improved diagnostic methods and medical therapies are necessary for early detection and treatment and an improved prognosis. It is thus vital to both examine and evaluate the role of the various existing proteins as biomarkers in carcinogenesis and to assess the contribution of these proteins in anti-cancer activity, for consideration in therapeutic strategies. It is essential to both examine and evaluate the role of the various existing proteins as biomarkers in carcinogenesis and to assess the contribution of these proteins in anti-cancer activity, for consideration in therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is twofold. Firstly, it is to evaluate recent data about which proteins can be utilized as biomarkers in carcinogenesis. The proteins reviewed include: CPTP, IL-6, CCN, and S100. Secondly, it is to evaluate the contribution of dietary proteins in cancer activity. Specifically, how whey protein, soy proteins and lectin, a phytochemical could be useful in cancer prevention and treatment.<br>\n<br>\nRecent Findings: Whey protein, present in dairy products, is an excellent source of the sulphur amino acid cysteine, the rate limiting substrate in glutathione synthesis. Notably, this protein survives digestion and has been shown to have anti-carcinogenic properties in animal studies. Lectins are phytochemicals present in plant foods, and have active components which alters cancer initiation, promotion and progression. Lectins have been characterized as a useful tool in biochemistry, cell biology, immunology and in diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in cancer research. Soy proteins contain various compounds, including isoflavones, protease inhibitors and protein kinase inhibitors, which have been proven effective in tumor growth inhibition. They have therefore, been greatly emphasized in cancer prevention and treatment. It has been proved that soy food consumption was associated with decreased risk of death and recurrence of breast cancer. CPTP is a recently discovered protein whose main role is to transport C1P, a pro-inflammatory molecule. The discovery of CPTP may shine a light on the mechanism of inflammatory diseases, and hopefully offer a potential target for therapeutic purposes in cancer research. Interleukin-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that affects the activity of cancer cells. It is involved in tumor growth, and elevated levels is associated with an increased risk of cancer. S100B is a well-established biomarker for malignant melanoma, and useful in assessing tumor load, stage and prognosis for patients with this disease. Other members of this family of proteins include S100A4, which has been associated with several malignancies and S100A2, which has been found to be decreased in some cancers. CCN are a group of regulatory proteins, located in the extracellular matrix (maricellular). They are involved in cellular adhesion, mitogenesis, chemotaxis, cell survival, and wound healing. CCN proteins are also able to modulate the signals of several proteins, which may also influence skeletal development and angiogenesis. Many of the functions of these proteins are thus also related to tumor growth. Furthermore, CCN interacts with estrogen in the development of cancer, and is implicated in some breast and ovarian cancers.",

                "abstract": "Recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have been attractive targets with their key roles in biological regulation through post-transcription to control mRNA stability and protein translation. Though melatonin was known as an anti-angiogenic agent, the underlying mechanism of melatonin in PC-3 prostate cancer cells under hypoxia still remains unclear. Thus, in the current study, we elucidated the important roles of miRNAs in melatonin-induced anti-angiogenic activity in hypoxic PC-3 cells. miRNA array revealed that 33 miRNAs (>2 folds) including miRNA3195 and miRNA 374b were significantly upregulated and 16 miRNAs were downregulated in melatonin-treated PC-3 cells under hypoxia compared to untreated control. Melatonin significantly attenuated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at mRNA level in hypoxic PC-3 cells. Consistently, melatonin enhanced the expression of miRNA3195 and miRNA 374b in hypoxic PC-3 cells by qRT-PCR analysis. Of note, overexpression of miRNA3195 and miRNA374b mimics attenuated the mRNA levels of angiogenesis related genes such as HIF-1alpha, HIF-2 alpha and VEGF in PC-3 cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, overexpression of miRNA3195 and miRNA374b suppressed typical angiogenic protein VEGF at the protein level and VEGF production induced by melatonin, while antisense oligonucleotides against miRNA 3195 or miRNA 374b did not affect VEGF production induced by melatonin. Also, overexpression of miR3195 or miR374b reduced HIF-1 alpha immunofluorescent expression in hypoxic PC-3 compared to untreated control. Overall, our findings suggest that upregulation of miRNA3195 and miRNA374b mediates anti-angiogenic property induced by melatonin in hypoxic PC-3 cells.",

In this review, we summarized the stages of esophageal cancer development associated with the loss or deregulation of epithelial cell apicobasal polarity. Loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity exerts an indispensable role in the initiation of esophageal oncogenesis, tumor progression, and the advancement of tumors from benign to malignant.

The YSY01A antiproliferative effect was stronger than that of PS341. In vivo, YSY01A (1.25, 2.25, and 3.25 mg/kg) inhibited PC-3M cell xenograft tumor growth, and the tumor volume inhibition rate was approximately 40% to 60%. YSY01A arrested PC-3M cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by flow cytometry (FCM). Many proteins related to the cell cycle were analyzed using western blot, and YSY01A was shown to increase p21, p27, cyclinB1, P-cdc2 (tyr15) and wee1 protein expression in both cells and tumor tissue in a concentration-dependent manner. YSY01A, a proteasome inhibitor, exerts anticancer effects on PC-3M cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of the YSY01A-mediated antitumor effect is that the cell cycle is arrested at the G2/M stage. This study suggests that YSY01A may be a novel therapeutic agent for prostate cancer.",

                "abstract": "Numerous studies have investigated the association of IL10 -819C>T and -592C>A polymorphisms with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) susceptibility, and yet reported conflicting results. With this in mind, we performed the current meta-analysis with an aim to verify actual causative variants underlying lymphomagenesis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations. Moreover, to explore the biological function of these polymorphisms, we also performed genotype-based mRNA expression analysis using online database derived from 270 subjects within three ethnicities. The final analysis included 11 studies with a total of 5859 NHL cases and 6893 controls for the IL10 -819C>T polymorphism, and 11 studies with 6277 cases and 7350 controls for the IL10 -592C>A polymorphism. No significant association was observed for these two polymorphisms in either the overall analysis or the stratification analyses by ethnicity and source of controls. Nevertheless, stratification analyses demonstrated a significant decreased risk associated with the IL10 -819C>T polymorphism (homozygous: OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.66-0.99, and recessive model: OR=0.80, 95%CI=0.65-0.98) and IL10 -592C>A polymorphism (homozygous: OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.66-0.99, and recessive model: OR=0.80, 95%CI=0.66-0.97) among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis indicates that polymorphisms in IL10 gene may contribute to DLBCL susceptibility.",

                "abstract": "Therapy with trastuzumab confers a survival benefit in HER2 positive advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. HER2 status is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). An ISH ratio of HER2 to centromere 17 (CEP17) \u22652.0 is considered amplified. This assumes that CEP17 reflects chromosomal copy number. Cases where CEP17 exceeds 3 are classified as polysomic, but it's unknown if they represent true polysomy or centromeric amplification. This has implications on the validity of current ISH criteria. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) allows simultaneous quantification of multiple loci and can distinguish between true polysomy and centromeric amplification. We selected 13 gastric cancers with CEP17 counts \u22653.0 (polyCEP17), and 8 non-polyCEP17 gastric cancer controls. Silver ISH for HER2 and CEP17 were performed and scored by manufacturer guidelines. We also performed an MLPA HER2 assay that evaluates 22 genes on chromosome 17. MLPA identified HER2 amplification in 7 polyCEP17 cases compared to 2 identified by ISH. Overall, 9 of 13 polyCEP17 cases had amplification of the peri-centromeric gene WSB1, compared to 1 of 8 non-polyCEP17 controls (p=0.02). This could account for ISH CEP17 counts \u22653.0. MLPA did not show any cases of complete chromosome 17 duplication and peri-centromeric amplification can explain most cases of ISH polyCEP17. Current ISH criteria may under-diagnose HER2 amplification in polyCEP17 cases due to flawed assumptions about polysomy. MLPA can detect HER2 amplification missed by IHC and ISH, and thus may be an effective ancillary technique in evaluating HER2 status.",

The recent association between the G84E polymorphism in the HOXB13 gene and PCa has been shown to result in a more aggressive cancer with an earlier onset of the disease. We examined the frequency of this mutation and other recurrent HOXB13 SNPs in patients with PCa and those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or no cancer.<br>\n<br>\nMethods: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on exons 1 and 2 of HOXB13 gene, followed by bidirectional Sanger Sequencing on peripheral blood from 232 PCa (age 46-92) and 110 BPH (age 45-84) patients.

Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression of GOLPH3 in PCa using a tissue microarray (TMA) and correlated our findings with pathological parameters of PCa. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence the expression of GOLPH3 in PC-3 cells and to measure the effects on proliferation and cell cycle using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Western blots were also employed to assess AKT-mTOR and cell cycle-related proteins.<br>\n<br>\nResults: We showed that the expression of GOLPH3 was located at the trans-Golgi membranes in PCa cells. We found that GOLPH3 was expressed in all PCa cells and was significantly higher in two androgen-independent cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. TMA immunohistochemistry showed that GOLPH3 was positive in 64% of cancer tissue samples compared with 20% in normal and 30% in benign samples (P<0.05). In vitro, silencing GOLPH3 expression inhibited cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Silencing GOLPH3 also activated P21 expression but suppressed the expression of CDK1/2 and cyclinB1 protein together with the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR.<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: The expression of the GOLPH3 protein was significantly elevated in PCa. GOLPH3 can promote cell proliferation by enhancing the activity of AKT-mTOR signaling.

Accumulated evidences suggest that intratumoral hypoxia, a characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors, promotes cancer cell motile and invasive abilities. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia, surrounding fibroblasts, and p16 expression on the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. We found that hypoxia promoted breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and cocultured fibroblasts stimulated invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Moreover, by using a Tet-on inducible system, we found that p16 is capable of inhibiting hypoxia-induced cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and suppressing cocultured fibroblast-stimulated invasiveness of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that p16, in addition to its well-known anti-tumor proliferation function, has novel anti-cancer properties capable of suppressing hypoxia-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion. This study may provide important validation for p16-mediated cancer therapy either by gene therapy or pharmacological activation of internal p16 gene that is usually inactive due to hypermethylation in the tumor cells.",

                "abstract": "Approximately 2.7 billion years ago, cyanobacteria began producing oxygen by photosynthesis. Any free oxygen they produced was chemically captured by dissolved iron or organic matter. There was no ozone layer to protect living species against the radiation from space. Eukaryotic cells lived in water, under hypoxic environments, and metabolized glucose by fermentation. The Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) describes the point when oxygen sinks became saturated. This massive oxygenation of the Earth occurred approximately half a billion years ago. Species that evolved after the GOE are characterized by aerobic metabolism. Mammals evolved approximately a few hundred million years ago, with the ancient eukaryotic genes deeply embedded in their genome.<br>\nMany genes have been exchanged by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) throughout the history of cellular evolution. Mammals have been invaded by viruses, and while viral genetic relics are embedded in mammalian junk genes, not all junk genes are genetic relics of viruses. These viral relics have been inactivated through evolution and have little impact on mammalian life. However, there is evidence to suggest that these viral genetic relics are linked to cancer.<br>\nThis hypothesis states that cancer develops when cell reproduction becomes defective because of the active involvement of viral genes, in a process similar to genetic engineering. Cancer cells are amalgamations of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are two main groups in cancer development. One group of cells arises by genetic engineering of a viral genetic relic, such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which evolved after oxygenation of the atmosphere. This group is referred to here as genetically modified organisms from viral genes (GMOV). GMOVs may be inhibited by anticancer drugs. The second group arises by engineering of the genes of ancient eukaryotes, which existed prior to the oxygenation of the Earth. This second group is referred to as genetically modified organisms from ancient eukaryotic genes (GMOE). The GMOE group lives in hypoxic environments and metabolizes glucose by fermentation. GMOEs represent advanced cancer, which proliferate aggressively and are resistant to DNA damage.<br>\nIt has been demonstrated that as an ERV becomes more prevalent in a mammalian genome, the possibility that the mammal will develop cancer increases. The hypothesis also states that most cancers have their origins in GMOV by the incorporation of viral genes from junk genes. As the cancer progresses, further subgroups of cancer GMOs will develop. If the cancer advances even further, the GMOE could eventually develop prior to late-stage cancer. Because the genes of ancient eukaryotes have enhanced innate immunity, GMOE will eventually prevail over the weaker GMOV during cancer subgroup competition. Hence, cancer development is mainly determined by genes in the mammalian genome.<br>\nAn inherent weakness of cancer cells is their dependence on glucose and iron. Furthermore, they cannot tolerate physical disturbance. Ancient gene GMOs can be treated with a combination of mechanical vibration using glucose-coated magnetic nanoparticles and strengthening of the immune system. Herein, I suggest trials for verifying this hypothesis.",

Also, progressive cytoplasmic expression of HSPB11 correlated with brain tumor malignancy. In the present study we investigated how cytoplasmic abundance of HSPB11 augments tumor malignancy. We up- and downregulated the cytoplasmic level of HSPB11 before paclitaxel exposure in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells, which normally express low and high levels, respectively, of the HSPB11 protein. We examined the paclitaxel-mediated induction of cell death, mitochondrial fission, HSPB11 mitochondrial translocation and inhibitory phosphorylation of dynamin-like protein-1 (DLP1). We found that increasing cytoplasmic abundance of HSPB11 in NIH3T3 cells protected against paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, while suppressing HSPB11 in HeLa cells sensitised the cells toward paclitaxel. Also, paclitaxel enhanced mitochondrial translocation of HSPB11 in wild type HeLa but not in NIH3T3 cells. More importantly, increased cytoplasmic level of HSPB11 in NIH3T3 cells enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of DLP1 and attenuated paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial fission. All these results suggest that increased cytoplasmic abundance of HSPB11 augments inhibitory phosphorylation of DLP1 thereby reduces mitochondrial fission that eventually leads to decreased apoptosis. This novel mechanism may explain the resistance to apoptosis and increased malignancy of HSPB11-overexpressing tumours. The clinical significance of this mechanism has already been highlighted by the finding that the kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A9 induces cancer cell death by DLP1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation.",

Then, we determined BTBD7 protein expressions in the paraffin-embedded samples from NSCLC patients, and analyzed the relations of BTBD7 expression with clinicopathologic features of the patients. The results showed that incidence of metastasis in patients with positive BTBD7 expression was significantly higher than that in those with negative BTBD7 expression, and the positive BTBD7 expression rate in metastatic cases was significantly higher than that in non-metastatic ones; furthermore, Cox regression analyses revealed that BTBD7 was an independent risk factor for either metastasis or survival in NSCLC patients.

Using gene expression dataset from matched prostate tumor and normal epithelial cells from an 80 GeneChip experiment examining 40 tumors and their matching normal pairs in 40 patients with known ERG status, we conducted a cancer signaling-focused functional analysis of prostatic carcinoma representing moderate and aggressive cancers stratified by ERG expression.<br>\nResults: In the present study of matched pairs of laser capture microdissected normal epithelial cells and well-to-moderately differentiated tumor epithelial cells with known ERG gene expression status from 20 patients with localized prostate cancer, we have discovered novel ERG associated biochemical networks.<br>\nConclusions: Using causal network reconstruction methods, we have identified three major signaling pathways related to MAPK/PI3K cascade that may indeed contribute synergistically to the ERG dependent tumor development. Moreover, the key components of these pathways have potential as biomarkers and therapeutic target for ERG positive prostate tumors.",

Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the COX proportional hazard model and binary logistic regression model.<br>\n<br>\nResults: A poorer 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was observed when pre-RT Hb<130.00 g/L. However, post-RT Hb<130.00 g/L was associated with significantly poorer 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.010) and disease specific survival (DSS) (P=0.008). Multivariate analysis with the COX proportional hazard model identified post-RT Hb<130.00 g/L as an independent negative prognostic factor for both LRFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.896; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.158-3.106; P=0.011) and DSS (HR, 1.767; 95% CI, 1.152-2.711; P=0.009). Similarly, \u25b3Hb <-15.00 g/L also predicted poorer 5-year LRFS (P=0.024) and DSS (P=0.015), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis as an independent adverse prognostic factor for LRFS (HR, 1.586; 95% CI, 1.058-2.377; P=0.026) and DSS (HR, 1.556; 95% CI, 1.087-2.227; P=0.016), respectively.

                "abstract": "Both transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulate important cellular processes, such as apoptosis in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms of regulation of PTHrP by TGF-\u03b2 are largely unknown. We hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 regulates the expression of PTHrP protein through a post-translational mechanism. Using hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines as the in vitro model, we investigated the effects of TGF-\u03b2 on protein expression and post-translational processing of PTHrP. We found that TGF-\u03b2 treatment led to protein degradation of PTHrP through the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. We also provided evidence to show that Smurf2 was the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of PTHrP. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry on human hepatocellular carcinoma specimens and a tissue array, we found that the expression of PTHrP was predominantly in the cancer cells, whereas the expression of TGF-\u03b2 was present in non-neoplastic liver tissue adjacent to hepatocellular carcinoma. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby TGF-\u03b2 may regulate PTHrP in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and lack of TGF-\u03b2 in hepatocellular carcinoma may promote cancer progression. Promotion of PTHrP degradation provides a novel target of therapeutic intervention to sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cytostatic and/or pro-apoptotic signals.",

This heterogeneity was felt to reflect site-dependent amounts of BM contents possibly due to structural and functional requirements. FDG uptake in the irradiated regions was significantly decreased on the first and second follow-ups after radiation. Feasibly, this could be due to a reduction in the number of active BM cells following intensive radiation in addition to concurrent chemotherapy. Overall, CBC significantly decreased after treatment.

Recent studies for the metastatic non-small cell lung cancer led to the ascertainment that the NSCLC does not constitute exclusively a disease entity, but different neoplasms guided from different molecular paths, different biological behavior and at extension requires different confrontation. Thus the new direction for the therapeutic approach of NSCLC is henceforth the most individualized approach based on the activated molecular paths of tumor. Distinct subtypes of NSCLC are driven by a specific genetic alteration, like EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or BRAF mutations, and these genetic alterations are sensitized to the inhibition of specific oncogenic pathways. The benefit from the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR mutations it was confirmed by six randomized studies of phase III that investigated the role of gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib. In these studies the response rates vary in the impressive percentages from 55% to 86% and were connected with a remarkable median progression free survival of approximately 8 to 13 months, and with better quality of life compared to that of chemotherapy. In early stages NSCLC is needed the individualization of systemic treatment in order to reduce toxicity that is observed in the classic chemotherapy and to impact outcome. The role of EGFR TKI's has been evaluated in the adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage resected NSCLC. The data from these studies suggest that adjuvant TKI therapy might not increase the overall survival, but delay the recurrences. Prospective trials restricted to EGFR or ALK driven NSCLC subsets potentially offering the opportunity for a definitive answer in early disease adjuvant setting (ALCHEMIST) or as induction treatment before stage III chemo-radiotherapy (RTOG 1210/Alliance 31101), are ongoing.

Here we discuss Restriction-based Multiple-fragment Assembly Strategy's advantages and limitations. In this strategy, rather than PCR amplifying the entire coding sequence (CDS) at one time, we amplified and sequenced smaller fragments which are shorter than 1.5kb spanning the CDS. After that, the sequence-proved fragments were assembled by digestion-ligation cloning to the target vector. We test its universality in our script programmed in Python. Our data shows that, among the entire human and mouse CDS, at least 70% of long CDS cloning will benefit from this strategy.",

                "abstract": "Platycodin-D (PD) is an effective triterpene saponin extracted from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum which has been used clinically to treat pulmonary diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, it has been reported that PD has anti-tumor effects in various cancer models through the induction of apoptosis. However, whether PD induces autophagy in both cell lines and its molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, our present study confirmed that PD induced autophagy in both NCI-H460 and A549 cells via up-regulating the expression levels of Atg-3, Atg-7 and Beclin-1. Meanwhile, PD contributed to the up-regulation of LC3-II at both protein and mRNA levels. Further detection of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway compared to LY294002 (PI3K kinase inhibitor), RAP (mTOR kinase inhibitor) and insulin (an activator of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway) showed that PD induced autophagy through inhibiting the pathway at p-Akt (Ser473), p-p70S6K (Thr389) and p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in both cell lines. Moreover, the examination of MAPK signaling pathway showed that PD treatment increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK, while decreased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in both cell lines. Additionally, the effects assessed with a panel of pharmacologic inhibitors, including U0126 (Erk1/2 kinase inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK kinase inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 MAPK kinase inhibitor) suggested that the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK participated in PD-induced autophagy. Taken together, these findings suggested that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and activating JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Therefore, PD may be an alternative compound for NSCLC therapy.",

One-hundred thirty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 62 years. N-RCT consisted of 36 - 50.4 Gy (median 45 Gy), 1.8 - 2 Gy per fraction. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) and cisplatin in 113 patients and cisplatin and taxan-derivates in 15 patients. Seven patients received a single cytotoxic agent. In 130 patients an abdominothoracal and in 5 patients a transhiatal resection was performed. The following dosimetric parameters were generated from the total lung DVH: mean dose, V5, V10, V15, V20, V30, V40, V45 and V50. The primary endpoint was the rate of intra- and postoperative mortality (from the start of N-RCT to 60 days after surgical resection).<br>\n<br>\nResults: A total of ten postoperative deaths (7%) were observed: 3 within 30 days (2%) and 7 between 30 and 60 days after surgical intervention (5%); no patient died during the operation. In the univariate analysis, weight loss (\u226510% in 6 months prior to diagnosis, risk ratio: 1.60, 95%CI: 0.856-2.992, p=0.043), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG 2 vs. 1, risk ratio: 1.931, 95%CI: 0.898-4.150, p=0.018) and postoperative pulmonary plus non-pulmonary complications (risk ratio: 2.533, 95%CI: 0.978-6.563, p=0.004) were significantly associated with postoperative mortality. There was no significant association between postoperative mortality and irradiated lung volumes. Lung V45 was the only variable which was significantly associated with higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary plus non-pulmonary complications (Exp(B): 1.285, 95%CI 1.029-1.606, p=0.027), but not with the postoperative pulmonary complications (Exp(B): 1.249, 95%CI 0.999-1.561, p=0.051).<br>\n<br>\nConclusions: Irradiated lung volumes did not show relevant associations with intra- and postoperative mortality of patients treated with moderate dose (36 - 50.4 Gy) conventionally fractionated conformal radiotherapy combined with widely used radiosensitizers. Postoperative mortality was significantly associated with greater weight loss, poor performance status and development of postoperative complications, but not with treatment-related factors. Limiting the volume of lung receiving higher radiation doses appears prudent because of the observed association with risk of postoperative complications.",

Plasma samples from 31 patients with HCC and 8 patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis were analyzed. In HCC group, most samples with large tumor size (tumor dimension greater than 50 mm) showed CNVs that are visually recognizable at chromosome CNV plots, few samples with small tumor and none samples with chronic liver diseases showed CNVs recognizable at CNV plots. CNV Z score analysis showed significant CNVs in samples with HCC and chronic liver diseases although more significant changes were found in HCC group, some are differentially valuable (such as gain in 1q, 7q, and 19q in HCC), while others are less differentially valuable (such as loss in 4q, 13q, gain in 17q, 22q). We proposed a CNV scoring method that generated positive result in 26 of the 31 HCC patients (83.9%) or 11 of the 16 HCC with tumor dimension 50 mm or less (68.8%) or 4 of the 7 HCC with tumor dimension 30 mm or less (57.1%), while all the 8 samples with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis scored negative. Ten HCC patients had normal or low serum AFP levels, among them, 7 were scored positive by CNV analysis, including 4 with tumor dimension 50 mm or less. Our study suggested that non-invasive genomic CNV analysis using plasma samples could be a valuable tool for early detection and differential diagnosis of HCC. Although CNV analysis itself cannot establish the diagnosis, it can help identify patients at high risk for HCC among patients with chronic liver diseases, which would prompt closer and more frequent surveillance for early tumor detection and intervention.",

In cases where groin hernias are present, it is imperative to resect the hernia sac, since it may contain tumor deposits.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts that may play important roles in GBM chemoresistance. We surmised that miRNA dysregulations may contribute to P4HB upregulation, hence chemoresistance. We found that miRNA-210 (miR-210) was P4HB-targeting and was highly downregulated in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. Forced overexpression of miR-210 led to P4HB downregulation and a reduction in TMZ-resistance. A reciprocal relationship between their expressions was also verified in clinical glioma specimens. Our study is the first to demonstrate a potential link between miR-210 and ER chaperone in determining chemosensitivity in GBM.

It has been previously proposed that lipiodol has the ability to modify the microenvironment matrix. In our current study we investigated this theory in BALBC mice. In total 160 BALBC mice were divided in eight groups: a) control, b) cisplatin, c) microwave, d) microwave and lipiodol, e) cisplatin and lipiodol, f) microwave and cisplatin, g) lipiodol and h) lipiodol, cisplatin and microwave. Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines (106) were injected into the right back leg of each mouse. After the 8th day, when the tumor volume was about 100mm3 the therapy application was initiated, once per week for four weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for each tumor when a mouse died or when sacrificed if they were still alive by the end of the experiment (8-Canal multifunctional spool; NORAS MRI products, Gmbh, Germany). Imaging and survival revealed efficient tumor apoptosis for the groups b,c,d,e and f. However; severe toxicity was observed in group h and no follow up was available for this group after the second week of therapy administration. Lipiodol in its current form does assist in a more efficient way the distribution of cisplatin, as the microwave apoptotic effect. Future modification of lipiodol might provide a more efficient method of therapy enhancement. Combination of drug and microwave ablation is possible and has an efficient apoptotic effect.",

                "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses have been seriously considered for glioma therapy over the last 20 years. The oncolytic activity of several oncolytic strains has been demonstrated against human glioma cell lines and in in vivo xenotransplant models. So far, four of these stains have additionally completed the first phase I/II trials in relapsed glioma patients. Though safety and feasibility have been demonstrated, therapeutic efficacy in these initial trials, when described, was only minor. The role of the immune system in oncolytic virotherapy for glioma remained much less studied until recent years. When investigated, the immune system, adept at controlling viral infections, is often hypothesized to be a strong hurdle to successful oncolytic virotherapy. Several preclinical studies have therefore aimed to improve oncolytic virotherapy efficacy by combining it with immune suppression or evasion strategies. More recently however, a new paradigm has developed in the oncolytic virotherapy field stating that oncolytic virus-mediated tumor cell death can be accompanied by elicitation of potent activation of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity that greatly improves the efficacy of certain oncolytic strains. Therefore, it seems the three-way interaction between oncolytic virus, tumor and immune system is critical to the outcome of antitumor therapy. In this review we discuss the studies which have investigated how the immune system and oncolytic viruses interact in models of glioma. The novel insights generated here hold important implications for future research and should be incorporated into the design of novel clinical trials.",

Methods: In this case-control study, 100 patients with breast cancer as case group and 100 healthy participants as a control group were compared. Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Demographic characteristics of the study population, as well as tumor size, tumor grade and stage were collected in a questionnaire designed for this study. The collected data were statistically analyzed by SPSS-16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) predictive analytic software using the Chi-square test. Results: The mean age of women was 43.42 &#177; 13.1 years. The AA genotype was frequent in case group (43%) whereas the AG genotype was found more in the control group (69%). There was no significant relationship between the studied polymorphisms and the grade, stage and size of the tumor, nor between the studied polymorphisms and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and lymph node involvement (P > 0.05). Significant association between the studied polymorphisms and breast cancer metastases was found (P = 0.02). Conclusion: According to the results of the study, the AA genotype is associated with breast cancer, but none of the studied gene polymorphisms is associated with prognostic factors such as tumor stage, grade or size.",

This study further evaluated HER2 status between primary gastric and breast invasive carcinomas and paired metastatic disease to lymph nodes. Methods: This study collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded representative tissue blocks from 62 gastric and 65 breast primary carcinomas as well as synchronous metastatic lymph nodes (male:female = 39:88; age ranged between 44 and 95 years with mean age of 69.32 years) for immunohistochemical staining of HER2 expression (DAKO HercepTest&#8482; kit). If immunohistochemical HER2 score reached to 2+, HER2 amplification was then assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (PharmDx&#8482; kit DAKO). Results: The discordant HER2 pooled rate, regardless either negative or positive conversion, was 9.67% in primary gastric carcinoma and corresponding nodal metastasis, while the changes in HER2 expression were revealed in 4.61% of mammary and lymph node neoplastic samples. A high-level concordance in HER2 expression between primary carcinoma and synchronous metastatic lymph nodes was confirmed in both types of cancer; the observed event of discordant HER2 status should be ascribed to intra-tumor heterogeneity, mostly appreciable in gastric cancer. Conclusion: In any case, the shift from positive to negative HER2 expression suggests that trastuzumab could be the targeted treatment choice whereas the opposite shift should be evaluated by a simultaneous HER2 determination in both primary and metastatic lymph nodes.",

Head and neck cancer is a leading health problem in India due to an increased incidence of tobacco use and poor oral hygiene. Squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa is common and roughly 2.5% of all malignancies that present to our center. Moreover, most patients present at late stages (III/IV) and consequently, survival rates are low. Bone metastasis in advanced cases of such carcinomas is rarely reported worldwide but is more prominent in parts of India. Methods: Here, we present a series of patients diagnosed with buccal mucosa carcinomas within the past 5 years that also demonstrated bone metastases. Results: These patients were young, with a history of tobacco chewing with locally advanced disease and bone metastases that developed within one year of diagnosis. Flat bones and vertebrae were mainly involved and the survival was short after diagnosis of metastasis despite treatment with local radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The cause of such frequent metastases cannot be proved but subclinical seeding of malignant cells before the eradication of the primary tumor is probable contributory with advanced local and nodal disease with high grade tumor. Conclusion: A pretreatment bone scan should be performed in locoregionally advanced buccal mucosa carcinomas at the time of diagnosis to define the treatment plan.",

The three individual treatments reduced the level of total p53 protein. These treatments also decreased Ser392 and Ser15 phosphorylated p53 in tumor samples of young patients and Ser315 phosphorylated p53 in old patients. Basal level of Thr55 phosphorylated p53 protein was present in all VS samples and it remained unchanged after treatments. The p53 protein from untreated VS samples showed reduced affinity to MDM2 binding in vitro and it increased significantly after treatments. The MDM2/p53 ratio increased approximately 3-fold in the treated VS tumor samples as compared to the control.

In this study we investigated how the tumor suppressor miR-204 and several transcription factors modulate main markers of mesenchymal transformation like E- and N-cadherin, SLUG, VEGF, and SOX-9 in prostate cancer cell line model (LNCaP, PC3, VCaP, and NCI-H660). We found that SLUG, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin are differentially modulated by miR-204, using miR-204 specific mimics and inhibitors and siRNA gene silencing (RUNX2, ETS-1, and cMYB). The genome perturbation associated TMPRSS2-ERG fusion coincided with shift from tumor-suppressor to tumor-promoting activity of this miRNA. The ability of miR-204 to suppress cancer cell viability and migration was lost in the fusion harboring cell lines. We found differential E-cadherin splicing corroborating to miR-204 modulatory effects. RUNX2, ETS1, and cMYB are involved in the regulation of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and VEGFA expression. RUNX2 knockdown results in SOX9 downregulation, while ETS1 and cMYB silencing result in SOX9 upregulation in VCaP cells. Their expression was found to be also methylation dependent.

Method. A cohort study starting in 2009 where patients were seen in the out-patient\u2019s clinic. All patients who presented with features suggestive of colon or rectal cancer were studied. Biopsies were performed to confirm CRC (especially rectal cancer); patients were then booked for admission and subsequent operation. Patients were excluded if the histopathology of a resected or biopsied mass turned out to be noncancerous or inflammatory. Demographic data like age and sex were recorded. The type of operation done, findings at surgery, and the histopathology of the resected specimen were all recorded.

                "abstract": "Tumor cells adapt to their high metabolic state by increasing energy production. To this end, current efforts in molecular cancer therapeutics have been focused on signaling pathways that modulate cellular metabolism. However, targeting such signaling pathways is challenging due to heterogeneity of tumors and recurrent oncogenic mutations. A critical need remains to develop antitumor drugs that target tumor specific pathways. Here, we discuss an energy metabolic pathway that is preferentially activated in several cancers as a potential target for molecular cancer therapy. In vitro studies have revealed that many cancer cells synthesize guanosine triphosphate (GTP), via the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway by upregulating the rate limiting enzyme of this pathway, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Non-proliferating cells use an alternative purine nucleotide synthesis pathway, the salvage pathway, to synthesize GTP. These observations pose IMPDH as a potential target to suppress tumor cell growth. The IMPDH inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is an FDA-approved immunosuppressive drug. Accumulating evidence shows that, in addition to its immunosuppressive effects, MMF also has antitumor effects via IMPDH inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Here, we review the literature on IMPDH as related to tumorigenesis and the use of MMF as a potential antitumor drug.",

The inhibitory activity of the tetracycline may be due to its ability to chelate metal ions such as calcium and zinc. Gelatin-zymography technique was used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity of both tetracycline and glutathione. The intensity of the bands corresponding to metalloproteinase activity in zymography gel was reduced in the presence of 50\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg/mL of tetracycline. The presence of 10\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg/mL of tetracycline in the medium increased the adherence of L929 cancer cells. These results clearly indicate the antimetastatic property of tetracycline. Reduced glutathione, a compound which is produced endogenously by the cells to maintain the redox status, was shown to inhibit the matrix metalloproteinase activity (in vitro). Therefore, it is assumed that decreased glutathione levels in synovial fluids or plasma might increase the activity of MMP.

The optimal screening test for CRC is still a subject of debate, and molecular stool sample analysis could provide a valid alternative to conventional methods in terms of compliance and practicability. Seven fecal DNA storage systems were evaluated in two successive phases. In the first phase of the study was selected the preservative buffer able to ensure the best human DNA recovery. In the second phase was evaluated human DNA stability, amplificability and integrity in DNA extracted from selected buffer. Results showed that the best performance was obtained in samples stored in 100\u2009mM EDTA buffer and Genefec buffer. Likewise buffer addition yielded a significant increase in DNA stability and integrity without PCR inhibition, compared to the matched aliquots with no buffer added. Our study shows that samples collected in stabilization solution stabilize DNA so that intact nucleic acids, are more effectively detectable in the molecular assay. DNA buffer preservation and storage conditions could be useful to guarantee the most consistent yield in human DNA. Stabilization buffer addition to stool samples prior to transport presents an easily implemented solution that appears to be highly effective. Overall DNA extracted from faeces preserved in preservative buffer can feasibility been used for molecular analysis leading to an increase of assay sensitivity.",

                "abstract": "Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat curable diseases such as germinative tumors and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The major limitation of bleomycin therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which can be life threatening in up to 10% of patients receiving the drug. The mechanism of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) involves oxidative damage, relative deficiency of the deactivating enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, genetic susceptibility, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, BIP can progress to lung fibrosis. The diagnosis of BIP is established by the combination of systemic symptoms, radiological and histological findings, and respiratory function tests abnormalities, while other disorders should be excluded. Although the diagnosis and pathophysiology of this disease have been better characterized over the past few years, there is no effective therapy for the disease. In general, the clinical picture is extremely complex. A greater understanding of the BIP pathogenesis may lead to the development of new agents capable of preventing or even treating the injury already present. Physicians who prescribe bleomycin must be aware of the potential pulmonary toxicity, especially in the presence of risk factors. This review will focus on BIP, mainly regarding recent advances and perspectives in diagnosis and treatment.",

The aim of this study was to assess in vitro biological activities of 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybenzoate lithium (HBLi) complexes on HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells by methods of using a metabolic activity assay, immunochemical and morphological techniques. Results showed that HBLi complexes exert their cytotoxic activities in a concentration- and chemical structure-dependent manner in the following order: 4-HBLi > 3-HBLi > 2-HBLi. Flow cytometry displayed evidence of apoptosis induced by 3-HBLi (21.8%) and 4-HBLi (33.2%). These results were verified by SEM, which revealed the formation of apoptotic bodies. In addition, these 3-HBLi and 4-HBLi caused an increase in HT-1080 cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase when compared to the controls (25% and 30.6%, resp.) when cells were treated with 6\u2009mM for 24 hours. Immunochemical studies related to the molecular mechanism of apoptosis indicated that HBLi complexes downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated Bax, p53, and caspases-3 in a concentration-dependent manner. HBLi complexes lowered Bcl-2/Bax ratios and induced the expression of p53 and caspase-3. These results suggest that HBLi complexes may exert their apoptotic effects through mitochondrial-mediated, caspase-dependent, apoptotic mechanisms.",

The field of angiogenesis has roots in the Hunterian era of the late eighteenth century but did not begin to blossom until the early 1970s when the then controversial findings and conclusions of Judah Folkman, the \u201cfather of angiogenesis,\u201d were first published. There were only 65 publications with angiogenesis in the title in the 10 years after Folkman first proposed the idea of tumour angiogenesis, compared to over 9,000 publications from the year 2000 to 2010. In this review we will explore the voyage of discovery from the first observations of John Hunter in the eighteenth century, via the struggle faced by Folkman to prove the importance of angiogenesis, and finally how his determination has led to modern angiogenesis inhibitors being used in everyday clinical practice.",

Since cytology is there to stay, at least in the median-term future, it is important to assess to what extent HIV-HPV coinfection impacts the accuracy of screening methods and strategies. Methods. We audited the correlation between cytological diagnosis of minimal abnormality (CIN1), CIN2+, or cancer and the histological diagnosis of colposcopy-directed large loop excision of the transformation zone of 399 HIV-uninfected controls and 389 HIV-infected cases. Results. The average age at diagnosis of CIN2+ of the cases was 4.2 years younger than controls (). The endpoint used to assess the accuracy of cytology was minimal cytological abnormality (\u2264CIN1/LGSIL). The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were 92.7, 18.5, 45.1, and 77.9%, respectively. The overall ratio of discordance/concordance between cytology and histology was similar in both groups. Conclusion. In LRS, where rapid-HPV testing is not yet part of screening algorithms, a cytological diagnosis of minimal abnormality requires visual inspection and treatment of visualized lesions especially in HIV-infected women aged 30 years. The cytological endpoint of accuracy should be set low to avoid false negative smears.",

This cycle continues until stable chromosomes are formed. The case of a 72-year-old female with refractory anaemia with excess blasts type 2 illustrates these events. Conventional cytogenetics produced a complex karyotype which included unstable abnormalities of chromosomes 11, 12, and 15. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses including multicolor-FISH (M-FISH) and multicolor-banding (M-BAND) revealed multiple clonal populations with 5 copies of MLL on either a ring chromosome composed entirely of chromosome 11 material or a derivative chromosome composed of chromosomes 11, 12, and 15. The FISH results also clarified the likely evolution of the karyotypic complexity. The simplest cell line contained a dic(12;15) in addition to copy number aberrations that are typical of MDS or AML. As the disease progressed, a ring 11 was formed. Subsequently, the ring 11 appears to have unwound and inserted itself into the dic(12;15) chromosome followed by an inversion of the derivative chromosome, producing a der(11;15;12). Telomeric loss and BFB cycles appear to have played an important role in the chromosomal rearrangements and clonal evolution demonstrated in the karyotype.",

Thus, autophagy plays a critical role in promoting cell integrity and maintaining proper function of cellular processes. Defects in autophagy, however, can have drastic implications in human health and diseases, including cancer. Described as a double-edged sword in the context of cancer, autophagy can act as both suppressor and facilitator of tumorigenesis. As such, defining the precise role of autophagy in a multistep event like cancer progression can be complex. Recent findings have implicated a role for components of the autophagy pathway in oncogene-mediated cell transformation, tumour growth, and survival. Notably, aggressive cancers driven by Ras oncoproteins rely on autophagy to sustain a reprogrammed mitochondrial metabolic signature and evade cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the role of oncogene-induced autophagy in cancer progression and discuss how modulators of autophagic responses can bring about therapeutic benefit and eradication of a subset of cancers that are addicted to this ancient recycling machinery.",

A cross-sectional study of female breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma incidence 2002\u20132006 by 5-year age group and local government area. Latitude, Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), and Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD) were assigned to local government areas. Latitude was grouped into bands (\u226427\u00b0S; >27\u201330\u00b0S; >30\u201333\u00b0S; >33\u201336\u00b0S, and >36\u00b0S), and IRSD was divided into quintiles and ARIA into four categories. Breast cancer rates were age standardized using the direct method. The joint effects of latitude, age, IRSD, and ARIA on incidence of breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma were assessed using multiple logistic regressions. Results. At latitudes south of 30\u00b0S, rates of breast cancer were over double that north of 27\u00b0S (76.4 versus 160.2\u2013176.5). Age-adjusted odds ratios of breast cancer were increased in all latitudes south of 30\u00b0S compared with north of 27\u00b0S within each IRSD and ARIA category (all ). After adjusting for age, IRSD, and ARIA, the odds ratio of breast cancer south of 30\u00b0S was 1.92 (95% CI 1.84\u20132.09; ), whereas cutaneous melanoma was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.68; ) times north of 30\u00b0S.

LPA with advanced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy rate of diagnosis excelled CA-125 in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (both P < 0.05). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (LPA: 0.983; CA-125: 0.910) were statistically significant compared with the reference (both P < 0.001) and the difference of the areas of ROC curve between LPA and CA-125 in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer showed statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The meta-analysis results suggested that plasma LPA levels were higher in ovarian cancer tissues than in benign tissues (standardized mean difference (SMD) =2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61-3.11, P < 0.001) and normal tissues (SMD = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.77-2.87, P < 0.001).\n Conclusion: LPA shows greater value in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer compared to CA-125 and may be employed as a biological index to diagnose ovarian cancer.",

The primary planning objective was to encompass 99% of planning target volume (PTV) by 95% of prescribed dose (54 Gy/30#). Assessments included target coverage (TC), homogeneity index (HI), and maximum (max) and minimum (min) dose. Hippocampal dose was assessed with mean, maximum, minimum, median dosem and various dose levels.\n<br>\n Results: Mean V 95 for PTV coverage in Tomo, IMRT, and SCRT were 99.7, 99.4, and 98.3%, respectively.

Tomotherapy (HI &#8804; 0.06) and IMRT (HI &#8804; 0.06) plans were more homogenous than SCRT (HI > 0.7) (P = 0.00). Right hippocampus mean dose with Tomo (20Gy) was 18.5% less than SCRT (30 Gy); but for left hippocampus, difference decreased to 3.3% (Tomo-32.2Gy and SCRT-34Gy). At 30% dose level, 9% more volume of right hippocampus was treated in IMRT and 20% in SCRT when compared to Tomo plan. At 80% dose, 6 and 12% more volumes were treated with IMRT and SCRT, respectively, in comparison to Tomo plan. For left hippocampus all three techniques were comparable.\n<br>\n Conclusion: Tomotherapy and Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based IMRT achieved significantly better PTV coverage than forward planned SCRT.

Cytosine Arabinoside (Ara-C) is widely used to treat hematological malignancy in humans, but often becomes ineffective because of increased resistance to the drug which may lead to a worse prognosis. Therefore new strategies are needed to understand the mechanism responsible for drug resistance and to develop new therapies to overcome it. Research evidence based on natural compounds used alone or in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents proved their efficacy to treat and prevent cancer. Hesperidin and Silibinin displayed anti-cancer activity against various types of cancers and cell lines and can be used in combination with Cytarabine with the aim to increase cytotoxicy profile and reduction in drug resistance.\n<br>\nExperimental Work: Primary cells obtained from AML patient's bone marrow were used to develop in-vitro model and further exposed to various concentration of Cytarabine (10 nM-5000 nM), Hesperidin (0.5 &#956;M-100 &#956;M) and Silibinin (0.5 &#956;M-100 &#956;M) alone and in combination with Cytarabine (Hesperidin-25 &#956;M, Silibinin10 &#956;M) to check cytotoxicity using MTT assay.

Short-term cultures of primary cells from endometrial tumors could be used for testing new anticancer therapeutics as well as for the development of personalized cancer therapy strategy. Here, the antitumor effect of a recombinant analogue of lactaptin (RL2), a new potential anticancer molecule, was examined against primary human endometrial cancer cells.\n<br>\nMaterials and Methods: Primary cell cultures of malignant and normal human endometrium were performed by enzymatic digestion of endometrial tissue from biopsy material. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) state of estrogen (ERs) and progesterone (PRs) hormone receptors and aromatase (Cyp 19) in cell cultures. Dynamic monitoring of cell adhesion and proliferation was made using the iCELLigence system (ASEA Biosciences). The sensitivity of cell cultures to conventional anticancer drugs and the lactaptin analog was estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, and the iCELLligence system.\n<br>\nResults: Established short-term primary cultures of endometrial cancer cells were ER&#945;/ER&#946;/PR-positive and sensitive for RL2. The IC 50 values of doxorubicin and cisplatin were determined for all of the primary cultures designed.

Survival after BCT in Pakistani population has not been reported. This study was carried out to report locoregional control and overall survival (OS) after BCT for invasive breast cancer and analyze prognostic factors in Pakistani population.\n<br>\nMaterials and Methods: Patients who received BCT between 1997 and 2009 were included in the study. Patients' follow-up, demographics, prognostic variables and treatment modalities were assessed. Data were analyzed for locoregional and distant relapse and estimated 10-year locoregional recurrence free survival (LRRFS) and OS was calculated using Kaplan Meier curves. To determine the significance of prognostic variables, univariate and multivariate analysis was performed.\n<br>\nResults: A total of 902 patients underwent BCT. Median age was 42 (17-82) years and the median follow-up was 51 (1.4-187) months. There were 484 (53.6) poorly differentiated and 194 (21.5) triple negative tumors. T3/T4 tumors were found in 128 (14.1) patients and 441 (44.8) patients had nodal involvement. Among adverse events, 58 (6.3) locoregional failures, 152 (16.8) distant failures and 155 (17.1) deaths were observed. Estimated 10 years LRRFS- was 88% while OS was 70%. On multivariate analysis, tumor size and nodal involvement were independent predictors of locoregional recurrence-free and OS.

Conventional breast and/or chest wall irradiation uses 2 Gy daily fractions, for 5-6 weeks. Such a long treatment schedule has major implications on both patient quality of life and burden of radiotherapy (RT) departments. Some investigators have hypothesized that breast cancer is as sensitive as normal breast tissue to fraction size. According to the hypothesis, small fraction sizes of 2.0 Gy or less offer no therapeutic advantage, and a more effective strategy would be to deliver fewer, larger fractions that result in a lower total radiation dose. This short (hypofractionated) RT schedule would be more convenient for patients (especially those coming from remote areas to RT facilities) and for healthcare providers, as it would increase the turnover in RT departments.

Intermediate and high risk oropharyngeal cancers have poor 5 year outcomes. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and dosimetric safety of 9% dose escalation in these tumors and compare the dose received by organs at risk (OAR) in escalated plans (67.2 Gy/28 fractions) versus (65 Gy/30 fractions) standard dose plans.\nMaterials and Methods: FDG-PET fused datasets were used to delineate gross, clinical and planning target volumes. Standard dose plans were created using two non IMRT techniques (conventional and field in field plans) whilst the patient was treated using a helical tomotherapy plan. A fourth dose escalation plan was obtained allowing comparison between the 20 plans of oropharyngeal cancer patients.\nResults: It was feasible to escalate dose to the FDG-PET avid tumor within the set constraints to that of planning target volume and OAR. Comparison of the escalated dose to that of standard plans showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) sparing of the mastication apparatus (MA) with escalated plans. Dose to the other critical and functional organs were comparable between the four plans.\nConclusion: Hypofractionated, slightly accelerated dose escalation in oropharyngeal cancers is likely to be safe and the chance of trismus is not any higher than when standard dose radiotherapy is used.

Melanoma results from transformed melanocytes in the skin. Data gathered on the association between the TP53 Arg72, Pro72 (rs1042522; G>C) polymorphism and melanoma are conflicting.\nAims: To assess the relationship between the TP53 genotype and the risk of melanoma, we performed a meta-analysis. \nMaterials and Methods: We searched on PubMed for studies of TP53 polymorphism published in English up to 12 th April 2014. For each study, we calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), assuming frequency of allele comparison, heterozygote comparison, homozygote comparison, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Seven case-control studies were carried out during the meta-analysis. \nResults: The TP53 Callele was not associated with the risk of melanoma in the frequency of allele comparison (C vs G: OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 0.824-1.290; P < 0.001 for heterogeneity). The TP53 GC genotype was not associated with the risk of melanoma as compared with the GG genotype (GC vs GG: OR = 0.922; 95% CI = 0.716-1.186; P = 0.010 for heterogeneity). The TP53 CC genotype was not associated with the risk of melanoma as revealed by both the homozygote comparison and the recessive genetic model. Analysis of the dominant model also did not indicate a significant association between the TP53 polymorphism and melanoma. \nConclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that genotypes for the TP53 rs1042522 G>C polymorphism might not be associated with the risk of melanoma.",

Postoperative radiotherapy is particularly useful in managing high-risk patients (tumors involving the pancreas, poorly differentiated histology, involved lymph nodes and positive margins). Here, we review our results of treatment of 84 patients treated by surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n<br>\nMaterial and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 84 patients of periampullary cancers treated in our department between January 2007 and December 2012 was carried out. All patients underwent Whipples surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy 45-50 Gy/25-28 number in those presenting with high-risk features. Radiotherapy was delivered using three-dimensional conformal technique with 6 MV photons using three field treatment plans. Chemotherapy was given for 6 cycles using gemcitabine and oxaliplatin regimen repeated 2 weekly.\n<br>\nResults: Eighty four postoperative patients with high-risk features were available for the final analysis. There were 69 males and 15 female patients. There were 34.5% stage I, 57.1% stage II and 8.3% stage III patients. At end of adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy 70% patients had a complete response, 7.5% had residual disease, 15% showed progressive disease, 5% were dead and 2.5% defaulted the treatment. The mean number of chemotherapy cycles received was 2.6. At 1 year follow-up the probability of disease free survival was 80% for node-negative patients versus 73% for node-positive disease (P = 0.27). Patients with stage up to IIA had a 1 year disease free survival of 83% versus 40% for patients with stage beyond IIA (P = 0.024).\n<br>\nConclusions: Our results showed a trend favoring lymph node negative status with disease free survival. With computed tomography based planning, adequate delineation of draining nodes is possible, and radiation toxicity has significantly decreased. Adequate coverage of nodal basins during radiotherapy planning is important, and stage of the disease seems to be an important prognostic factor.",

Control (CONT, n = 7); irradiation alone RT: radiation therapy (RT, n = 8); amifostine plus irradiation (AMI + RT, n = 8); LC plus irradiation (LC + RT, n = 8); LC and sham irradiation (LC, n = 7); and amifostine and sham irradiation (AMI, n = 7). The rats in the AMI + RT, LC + RT and RT groups were irradiated with a single dose of 20 Gy to the whole abdomen. LC (300 mg/kg) and amifostine (200 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 30 min before irradiation. Five days after irradiation, both antral follicles and corpus luteum in the right ovaries were counted, and tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) were measured.\n Results: Irradiation significantly decreased antral follicles and corpus luteum (P: 0.005 and P < 0.0001). LC increased the median number of antral follicles and corpus luteum (P: 0.009 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Amifostine improved median corpus luteum numbers but not antral follicle (P < 0.000, P > 0.05). The level of MDA and AOPP significantly increased after irradiation (P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively).

The absence of electron beams and the inability to seamlessly deliver inverse planned intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) segments, mean that some out-of-the-box thinking is mandatory for the full range of required treatments in different clinical settings, but is ultimately very rewarding. Our department started off in July 2011, with the Elekta Compact, equipped with MLCi2 and a camera-based electron portal imaging device. For head-neck cancers, we have successfully utilized a 3D conformal class-solution of eight-to-nine oblique beams, with multiple segments, to deliver an adequate dose to the posterior neck, respecting spinal cord tolerance. Parotid gland sparing is possible in selected node-negative hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancers. For prostate cancers, we have developed a forward-planned IMRT protocol to routinely deliver 76-80 Gy to the prostate, with margins, while conforming to the same rectal dose-volume constraints as in inverse IMRT. Response and tolerance have been excellent so far. In head-neck cancers, the majority (71%) of patients was locally advanced; however, complete response was achieved in 75% of the cases. Grade 3 acute toxicities were seen in only 7% of the cases and compliance overall was excellent, with no patients requiring a gap in treatment. We achieved biochemical control in 100% of the prostate cancer patients; no patients had grade 3 acute toxicities, and with a median follow-up of 12 months, have yet to see any late rectal bleeding. Although engineered for simplicity and versatility, the Compact requires some innovative thinking by clinicians/physicists to optimize the full range of its possibilities. However, upgrades like inverse IMRT delivery, which are in the pipeline, are urgently needed for it to be viable, especially in a single-accelerator department.",

However, their physical signs disappeared after the treatment with bevacizumab. One case of brainstem lesion and one case of brain glioma patient showed a transient improvement in signs and symptoms after treatment with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab can significantly alleviate the radiation-induced brain edema, and can improve the symptoms successively.",

Four patients of CSI were retrospectively planned with 3DCRT, RA+FA, and RA+AS. Conformity-Index (CI), Homogeneity-Index (HI), and Paddick Gradient-Index (GI) were calculated. Quantitative evaluation was done using DVH analysis for PTVs and OARs. When compared with 3DCRT, GI, CI, and HI were favorable to RA based techniques. In comparison with 3DCRT the doses to OARs were lower with RA+AS with the difference being statistically significant in most instances. RA+AS significantly decreases the dose to OARs and their volumes receiving low doses in comparison with RA+FA and 3DCRT.",

The etiology of this problem is largely unknown, so the present study aimed to assess cognitive functioning in childhood patients with cancer and to investigate the proposed disposing factors including variables related to disease, treatment, and some socio-demographic characteristics. In a case control study parents of 67 cancer patients aged 8-12 years, completed the parent proxy report of PedsQL\u2122 3.0 Cognitive Functioning Scale (Arabic versions), as well as a separate sheet for socio-demographic data. Control group consisted of 37 healthy subjects from the same age group were subjected to the same methodology for comparison. All patients under the study have successfully accomplished their treatment protocol and were in complete remission during the evaluation. Hematological malignancies represented 70.1% of the patients sample, with the highest proportion for ALL (52.2%). Brain tumors represented 40% of the solid malignancies (29.9% of the study patients). Cognitive functioning score was significantly lower in the solid group (69.6\u00b137.3) compared to the hematologic group (85.1\u00b122.2) (t = 2.1, p =0.038). Cognitive functioning score was also lower in solid group versus control subjects (p =0.047), while it showed no significant difference between hematological malignancies and control group. Older age at diagnosis, urban residence, illiterate mothers, higher duration of treatment as well as long duration of hospital admission were associated with a lower cognitive score in the solid tumors group compared to hematological group.",

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nAdoptive T cell transfer (ACT) is currently under investigation for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Recent evidence suggests that the coinhibitory PD-1-PD-L1 axis plays a major role in ACT failure. We hypothesized that a new fusion receptor reverting PD-1&ndash;mediated inhibition into CD28 costimulation may break peripheral tolerance.\n\n\nMethods:\nDifferent PD-1-CD28 fusion receptor constructs were created and retrovirally transduced into primary T cell receptor transgenic murine CD8+ T cells specific for ovalbumin (OT-1). Cytokine release, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and tumor recognition were analyzed in vitro. Antitumor efficacy and mode of action were investigated in mice bearing subcutaneous tumors induced with the pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc02 expressing the model antigen ovalbumin (Panc-OVA). For antitumoral efficacy, six to eight mice per group were used. All statistical tests are two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nTransduction of the PD-1-CD28 receptor constructs mediated enhanced cytokine release, T cell proliferation, and T cell&ndash;induced lysis of target tumor cells. The PD-1-CD28 receptor function was dependent on two of the CD28-signaling motifs and IFN- release. Treatment of mice with established Panc-OVA tumors with fusion receptor&ndash;transduced OT-1 T cells mediated complete tumor regression. Mice rejecting the tumor were protected upon subsequent rechallenge with either ovalbumin-positive or -negative tumors, indicative of a memory response and epitope spreading in nine of 11 mice vs none of the six na&iuml;ve mice (P < .001). Treatment efficacy was associated with accumulation of IFN-&ndash;producing T cells and an increased ratio of CD8+ T cells to immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumors.\n\n\nConclusions:\nTransduction of T cells with this new PD-1-CD28 receptor has the potential of breaking the PD-1-PD-L1&ndash;immunosuppressive axis in ACT.\n",

                "abstract": "Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapies offer diverse strategies for cancer treatment. Among the most promising approaches is the blockade of immune checkpoint molecules to activate antitumor immunity. With targeted immunotherapies of new mechanisms of action come greater challenges in study design and statistical analysis, as well as the need for refining clinical trial endpoints. The long-term survival and delayed clinical effects demonstrated by these therapies could result in substantial prolongation of study duration and loss of statistical power if these key attributes are not accounted for in the study design and statistical analyses. In the Brookings Conference on Clinical Cancer Research held in Washington, DC, in November 2013, several intermediate clinical endpoints, including milestone overall survival, were proposed for the evaluation of cancer immunotherapies to take into account the possibility of delayed treatment effect and to better characterize the clinical activity profile of such agents, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this manuscript, the use of milestone survival is described as a potential efficacy endpoint for immune checkpoint inhibitors in late-stage drug development that could potentially mitigate the challenge of accelerating the drug development process when the strength of this class of agents is derived from long-term follow-up.",

We used traditional multivariable analysis, propensity score&ndash;based analysis, coarsened exact matching, and an instrumental variable analysis to compare survival for individuals who did or did not receive an hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Survival was measured by Cox proportional hazard models. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nPatients with MM receiving an HSCT were more likely to be white, married, younger, and have fewer comorbidities. Results from all analytic techniques consistently showed that HSCT statistically significantly improved survival, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 0.531 to 0.608 (traditional multivariable analysis: HR = 0.582, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.69; propensity score analysis: HR = 0.572, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.72; coarsened exact matching: HR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.76; instrumental variable analysis: HR = 0.531, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.78, all P values &le; .001).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nOverall survival has increased among patients with MM receiving HSCT.

                "abstract": "A recent study reports that the log lifetime incidence rate across a selection of 31 cancer types is highly correlated with the log of the estimated tissue-specific lifetime number of stem cell divisions. This observation, which underscores the importance of errors in DNA replication, has been viewed as implying that most cancers arise through unavoidable bad luck, leading to the suggestion that research efforts should focus on early detection, rather than etiology or prevention. We argue that three statistical issues can, if ignored, lead analysts to incorrect conclusions. Statistics for traffic fatalities across the United States provide an example to demonstrate those inferential pitfalls. While the contribution of random cellular events to disease is often underappreciated, the role of chance is necessarily difficult to quantify. The conclusion that most cases of cancer are fundamentally unpreventable because they are the result of chance is unwarranted.",

The purpose of this study was to examine women presenting clinically with second breast cancers after negative surveillance mammography (interval cancers), and to estimate the five-year risk of interval-invasive second cancers for women with varying risk profiles.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nWe evaluated a prospective cohort of 15 114 women with 47 717 surveillance mammograms diagnosed with stage 0-II unilateral PBC from 1996 through 2008 at facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We used discrete time survival models to estimate the association between odds of an interval-invasive second breast cancer and candidate predictors, including demographic, PBC, and imaging characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nThe cumulative incidence of second breast cancers after five years was 54.4 per 1000 women, with 325 surveillance-detected and 138 interval-invasive second breast cancers. The five-year risk of interval-invasive second cancer for women with referent category characteristics was 0.60%. For women with the most and least favorable profiles, the five-year risk ranged from 0.07% to 6.11%. Multivariable modeling identified grade II PBC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 3.31), treatment with lumpectomy without radiation (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.91 to 5.62), interval PBC presentation (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.16), and heterogeneously dense breasts on mammography (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.36) as independent predictors of interval-invasive second breast cancers.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nPBC diagnosis and treatment characteristics contribute to variation in subsequent-interval second breast cancer risk.

We investigated the role of the histone demethylase KDM4B in N-Myc&ndash;mediated neuroblastoma pathogenesis.\n\n\nMethods:\nSpearman correlation was performed to correlate MYCN and KDM4B expression. RNA interference, microarray analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to define the functions of KDM4B. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to assess protein-protein interactions between N-Myc and KDM4B. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to assess the binding of Myc targets. Constitutive and inducible lentiviral-mediated KDM4B knockdown with shRNA was used to assess the effects on tumor growth. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of KDM4B expression. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\n   KDM4B and MYCN expression were found to be statistically significantly correlated in a variety of cancers, including neuroblastoma (R = 0.396, P < .001). Functional studies demonstrated that KDM4B regulates the Myc pathway. N-Myc was found to physically interact with and recruit KDM4B. KDM4B was found to regulate neuroblastoma cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo (5 mice/group, two-tailed t test, P &le; 0.001). Finally, together with MYCN amplification, KDM4B was found to stratify a subgroup of poor-prognosis patients (122 case patients, P < .001).\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur findings provide insight into the epigenetic regulation of Myc via histone demethylation and proof-of-concept for inhibition of histone demethylases to target Myc signaling in cancers such as neuroblastoma.\n",

                "abstract": "General frameworks of the cancer screening process are available, but none directly compare the process in detail across different organ sites. This limits the ability of medical and public health professionals to develop and evaluate coordinated screening programs that apply resources and population management strategies available for one cancer site to other sites. We present a trans-organ conceptual model that incorporates a single screening episode for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers into a unified framework based on clinical guidelines and protocols; the model concepts could be expanded to other organ sites. The model covers four types of care in the screening process: risk assessment, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Interfaces between different provider teams (eg, primary care and specialty care), including communication and transfer of responsibility, may occur when transitioning between types of care. Our model highlights across each organ site similarities and differences in steps, interfaces, and transitions in the screening process and documents the conclusion of a screening episode. This model was developed within the National Cancer Institute&ndash;funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR). PROSPR aims to optimize the screening process for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer and includes seven research centers and a statistical coordinating center. Given current health care reform initiatives in the United States, this conceptual model can facilitate the development of comprehensive quality metrics for cancer screening and promote trans-organ comparative cancer screening research. PROSPR findings will support the design of interventions that improve screening outcomes across multiple cancer sites.",

Total estrogens correlated with &alpha;-diversity in control patients (Spearman Rho = 0.37, P = .009) but not case patients (Spearman Rho = 0.04, P = .77). Compared with control patients, case patients had statistically significantly altered microbiota composition (&beta;-diversity, P = .006) and lower &alpha;-diversity (P = .004). Adjusted for estrogens and other covariates, odds ratio of cancer was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.30 to 0.85) per &alpha;-diversity tertile. Differences in specific taxa were not statistically significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons. This pilot study shows that postmenopausal women with breast cancer have altered composition and estrogen-independent low diversity of their gut microbiota.

Medicare D claims were used to calculate AI adherence, defined as a medication possession ratio of 80% or more of eligible days, over 36 months.

Its optimal management remains largely undefined given a lack of prospective, randomized data to inform practice. We sought to describe modern practice patterns in the management of cN+ PCa and assess the effect of adding radiation therapy (RT) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on survival using the National Cancer Data Base.\n\n\nMethods:\nPatients with cN+ PCa and without distant metastases diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 were included. Five-year overall survival for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 and treated with ADT alone or ADT+RT were compared. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to balance baseline characteristics, and Cox multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality.\n\n\nResults:\nOf 3540 total patients, 32.2% were treated with ADT alone and 51.4% received ADT+RT. Compared with ADT alone, patients treated with ADT+RT were younger and more likely to have private insurance, lower comorbidity scores, higher Gleason scores, and lower PSA values. After PS matching, 318 patients remained in each group. Compared with ADT alone, ADT+RT was associated with a 50% decreased risk of five-year all-cause mortality (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.67, two-sided P < .001; crude OS rate: 71.5% vs 53.2%).\n\n\nConclusions:\nUsing a large national database, we have identified a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with cN+ PCa treated with ADT+RT.

For every case patient, four eligible control patients matched on age, sex, practice site, and duration of follow-up before index date were selected using incidence density sampling. Exposure was THR therapy before index date. We further divided the THR unexposed group into patients with hypothyroidism (TSH > 4mg/dl), patients with hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.4mg/dl), and subjects without documented thyroid abnormality. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC were estimated using conditional logistic regression.

In contrast, hyperthyroidism (adjusted OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.36, P = .001) or untreated hypothyroidism (adjusted OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.24, P < .001) were associated with increased risk of CRC.\n\n\nConclusion:\nLong-term THR is associated with a decreased risk of CRC. Hyperthyroidism and untreated hypothyroidism are associated with modestly elevated risk of CRC.\n",

                "abstract": "<br>\nBackground:<br>\nPharmacological activation of cannabinoid receptors elicits antitumoral responses in different cancer models. However, the biological role of these receptors in tumor physio-pathology is still unknown.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nWe analyzed CB2 cannabinoid receptor protein expression in two series of 166 and 483 breast tumor samples operated in the University Hospitals of Kiel, T&uuml;bingen, and Freiburg between 1997 and 2010 and CB2 mRNA expression in previously published DNA microarray datasets. The role of CB2 in oncogenesis was studied by generating a mouse line that expresses the human V-Erb-B2 Avian Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2) rat ortholog (neu) and lacks CB2 and by a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches in human breast cancer cells in culture and in vivo, upon modulation of CB2 expression by si/shRNAs and overexpression plasmids. CB2-HER2 molecular interaction was studied by colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays. Statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nWe show an association between elevated CB2 expression in HER2+ breast tumors and poor patient prognosis (decreased overall survival, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09 to 0.71, P = .009) and higher probability to suffer local recurrence (HR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.049 to 0.54, P = .003) and to develop distant metastases (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.75, P = .009). We also demonstrate that genetic inactivation of CB2 impairs tumor generation and progression in MMTV-neu mice. Moreover, we show that HER2 upregulates CB2 expression by activating the transcription factor ELK1 via the ERK cascade and that an increased CB2 expression activates the HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling at the level of the tyrosine kinase c-SRC. Finally, we show HER2 and CB2 form heteromers in cancer cells.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nOur findings reveal an unprecedented role of CB2 as a pivotal regulator of HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling in breast cancer, and they suggest that CB2 may be a biomarker with prognostic value in these tumors.<br>\n",

Recent guidance documents have recommended that the accuracy of predictive biomarkers, ie, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, should be assessed. We clarify the meanings of these entities for predictive markers and demonstrate that generally they cannot be estimated from data without making strong untestable assumptions. Language suggesting that predictive biomarkers can identify patients who benefit from an intervention is also widespread. We show that in general one cannot estimate the chance that a patient will benefit from treatment. We recommend instead that predictive biomarkers be evaluated with respect to their ability to predict clinical outcomes among patients treated and among patients receiving standard of care, and the population impact of treatment rules based on those predictions. Ideally these entities are estimated from a randomized trial comparing the experimental intervention with standard of care.",

Yet information about recurrence is not collected in cancer registries or other population-based data sources. To address the lack of population-based recurrence information, researchers are increasingly using algorithms applied to health claims to infer recurrence. However, the validity of these approaches has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this commentary, we review existing studies and discuss options for improving the availability of recurrence data. We found that the validity of claims-based approaches appears promising in small, single institution studies, but larger population-based studies have identified substantial limitations with using claims to identify recurrence. With the increasing availability of health data, there are potential options that can be implemented to enhance information about recurrence. These options include design of software for the electronic medical record that enables rapid and standardized reporting of recurrence, use of electronic pathology reports to facilitate streamlined collection of recurrence by cancer registries, and mandates by insurers to require reporting of recurrence on health claims submitted by physicians. All of these options will require that governmental agencies, health insurers, professional societies, and other groups recognize the importance of population-based recurrence data and determine that this information is a priority for assessing cancer outcomes and costs.",

The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and FcRIIB-/- mice (n = 3&ndash;18 per group).

Their simulation studies found no statistical difference in OS because of dilution effect from SPP, although there was a statistical difference in PFS between treatment arms. Recently, two phase III clinical trials showed efficacy of experimental treatments in OS, but not PFS. These results seem counterintuitive, because it may be reasonable to consider that the effect of treatment in prolonging PFS can influence OS prolongation. We conducted simulations to examine the role of SPP in OS under the assumption that only SPP, and not PFS, differed between treatment arms. We also explored the impact of patient heterogeneity on the OS analysis. Our study offers a reasonable explanation for the two phase III trials and recommends further discussion of PFS as an adequate endpoint and what role SPP might play in OS to evaluate current treatment regimens.",

Upon malignant transformation of islet cells into pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), AKT is frequently overexpressed and mutations in the AKT/mTOR pathway are detected. Because mTOR inhibitors rarely induce PanNET tumor regression, partly because of feedback activation of AKT, novel combination strategies are needed to target FAK/AKT/mTOR signaling.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nWe characterized the activation of FAK in PanNETs using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis and tested the FAK inhibitor PF-04554878 in human PanNET cells in vitro and in vivo (at least three mice per group). In addition, we evaluated the effect of combined FAK and mTOR inhibition on PanNET viability and apoptosis. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nWe found that FAK is overexpressed and hyperphosphorylated in human PanNETs and that PF-04554878 strongly inhibited FAK (Tyr397) autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner.

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nSerine hydrolases (SHs) are among the largest classes of enzymes in humans and play crucial role in many pathophysiological processes of cancer. We have undertaken a comprehensive proteomic analysis to assess the differential expression and cellular localization of SHs, which uncovered distinctive expression of Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), the most efficient carboxyl esterase in activating the prodrug irinotecan into SN-38, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We therefore assessed the extent of heterogeneity in CES2 expression in PDAC and its potential relevance to irinotecan based therapy.\n\n\nMethods:\nCES2 expression in PDAC and paired nontumor tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CES2 activity was assessed by monitoring the hydrolysis of the substrate p-NPA and correlated with irinotecan IC50 values by means of Pearson&rsquo;s correlation. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and CES2 expression in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nStatistically significant overexpression of CES2, both at the mRNA and protein levels, was observed in PDAC compared with paired nontumor tissue (P < .001), with 48 of 118 (40.7%) tumors exhibiting high CES2 expression. CES2 activity in 11 PDAC cell lines was inversely correlated with irinotecan IC50 values (R = -0.68, P = .02). High CES2 expression in tumor tissue was associated with longer overall survival in resectable and borderline resectable patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment (hazard ratio = 0.14, 95% confidence interval = 0.04 to 0.51, P = .02).\n\n\nConclusion:\nOur findings suggest that CES2 expression and activity, by mediating the intratumoral activation of irinotecan, is a contributor to FOLFIRINOX sensitivity in pancreatic cancer and CES2 assessment may define a subset of patients likely to respond to irinotecan based therapy.\n",

HPV testing was performed on 2670 case patients that were fairly representative of all participating cancer registry cases by age and sex. Demographic and clinical data were evaluated by anatomic site and HPV status. Current US cancer registry data and the detection of HPV types were used to estimate the number of cancers potentially preventable through vaccination.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nHPV DNA was detected in 90.6% of cervical, 91.1% of anal, 75.0% of vaginal, 70.1% of oropharyngeal, 68.8% of vulvar, 63.3% of penile, 32.0% of oral cavity, and 20.9% of laryngeal cancers, as well as in 98.8% of cervical cancer in situ (CCIS). A vaccine targeting HPV 16/18 potentially prevents the majority of invasive cervical (66.2%), anal (79.4%), oropharyngeal (60.2%), and vaginal (55.1%) cancers, as well as many penile (47.9%), vulvar (48.6%) cancers: 24 858 cases annually. The 9-valent vaccine also targeting HPV 31/33/45/52/58 may prevent an additional 4.2% to 18.3% of cancers: 3944 cases annually. For most cancers, younger age at diagnosis was associated with higher HPV 16/18 prevalence. With the exception of oropharyngeal cancers and CCIS, HPV 16/18 prevalence was similar across racial/ethnic groups.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nIn the United States, current vaccines will reduce most HPV-associated cancers; a smaller additional reduction would be contributed by the new 9-valent vaccine.<br>\n",

Similar cognitive compromise has been observed in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, and PTSD symptoms are a frequent concomitant of cancer diagnosis. We tested the hypothesis that pretreatment cognitive impairment is attributable to cancer-related post-traumatic stress.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nWomen aged 65 years or younger who were diagnosed with breast cancer (case patients) or had undergone negative routine breast imaging (control patients) at one of six participating breast centers underwent traditional and computerized neuropsychological testing, clinician-administered diagnostic assessment of stress disorders, and self-report assessments of cognitive function and depression. To minimize confounding, case patients were evaluated prior to any local or systemic treatment. Cognitive indices of case patients, control patients, and normative samples were compared. The patients&rsquo; risk of overall cognitive impairment was determined. Linear regression and a mediation model were used to test the study hypothesis. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nThe 166 case patients and 60 well-matched control patients showed near-identical deviations from population norms. Case patients scored worse than control patients on two of 20 cognitive indices (Go/Nogo commission errors, Go/Nogo omission errors). Self-reported cognitive problems were associated with Go/Nogo omission errors and more pronounced in case patients. Only PTSD symptoms (Beta = 0.27, P = .004) and age (Beta = 0.22, P = .04) statistically significantly predicted Go/Nogo errors.

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nSeveral treatment strategies target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast carcinomas, including monoclonal antibodies directed against HER2&rsquo;s extracellular domain (ECD) and small molecule inhibitors of its tyrosine kinase activity. Yet, novel therapies are needed that prevent HER2 dimerization with other HER family members, because current treatments are only partially effective.\n\n\nMethods:\nTo test the hypothesis that HER2 activation requires a protein sequence in the HER2-ECD that mediates HER2 homo- and heterodimerization, we introduced a series of deletion mutations in the third subdomain of HER2-ECD. These deletion mutants were retrovirally expressed in breast cancer (BC) cells that naturally overexpress HER2 and in noncancerous, HER2-negative breast epithelial cells. One-factor analysis of variance or Student&rsquo;s t test were used to analyze differences. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nThe smallest deletion in the ECD domain of HER2, which removed only 16 amino acids (HER2-ECD451&ndash;466), completely disrupted the oncogenic potential of HER2. In contrast to wild-type HER2, the mutant-inhibited anchorage-independent growth (mean number of colonies: mutant, 70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 55 to 85; wild-type, 400, 95% CI = 320 to 480, P < .001) increased sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment in both transformed and nontransformed cells. Overexpression of HER2451&ndash;466 efficiently inhibited activation of HER1, HER2, and HER3 in all cell lines tested.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThese findings reveal that an essential \"activating\" sequence exists in the extracellular domain of HER2. Disruption of this sequence disables the HER2 dimerization loop, blocks subsequent activation of HER2-driven oncogenic signaling, and generates a dominant-negative form of HER2. Reagents specifically against this molecular activation switch may represent a novel targeted approach for the management of HER2-overexpressing carcinomas.\n",

All women received biennial screening starting at age 50 years with cessation ages varying from 74 up to 96 years. We estimated the number of life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-years, breast cancer deaths averted, false-positives, and overdiagnosed women per 1000 screens.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nThe models predicted that there were 7.8 to 11.4 LYG per 1000 screens at age 74 years (range across models), decreasing to 4.8 to 7.8 LYG per 1000 screens at age 80 years, and 1.4 to 2.4 LYG per 1000 screens at age 90 years. When adjusted for quality-of-life decrements, the LYG decreased by 5% to 13% at age 74 years and 11% to 22% at age 80 years. At age 90 to 92 years, all LYG were counterbalanced by a loss in quality-of-life, mainly because of the increasing number of overdiagnosed breast cancers per 1000 screens: 1.2 to 5.0 at age 74 years, 1.8 to 6.0 at age 80 years, and 3.7 to 7.5 at age 90 years.

However, to implement genomically informed therapy requires that a clinician interpret the patient&rsquo;s molecular profile, including molecular characterization of the tumor and the patient&rsquo;s germline DNA. In this Commentary, we review existing data and tools for precision oncology and present a framework for reviewing the available biomedical literature on therapeutic implications of genomic alterations. Genomic alterations, including mutations, insertions/deletions, fusions, and copy number changes, need to be curated in terms of the likelihood that they alter the function of a \"cancer gene\" at the level of a specific variant in order to discriminate so-called \"drivers\" from \"passengers.\" Alterations that are targetable either directly or indirectly with approved or investigational therapies are potentially \"actionable.\" At this time, evidence linking predictive biomarkers to therapies is strong for only a few genomic markers in the context of specific cancer types. For these genomic alterations in other diseases and for other genomic alterations, the clinical data are either absent or insufficient to support routine clinical implementation of biomarker-based therapy. However, there is great interest in optimally matching patients to early-phase clinical trials. Thus, we need accessible, comprehensive, and frequently updated knowledge bases that describe genomic changes and their clinical implications, as well as continued education of clinicians and patients.",

In contrast, longitudinal age-specific rates were proportional (similar) among all Asian countries and the United States with incidence rates rising continuously until age 80 years. The extrapolated estimates for the most recent cohorts in some Asian countries actually showed later ages at onset than in the United States. Additionally, over successive birth cohorts, the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the longitudinal curves converged (narrowed) between Asian and US white women.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nSimilar longitudinal age-specific incidence rates along with converging IRRs indicate that the age effects for invasive breast cancer are more similar among Asian and Western populations than might be expected from a solely cross-sectional analysis.

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nThe NCIC CTG LY.12 study showed that gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) were noninferior to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive histology lymphoma prior to autologous stem cell transplantation. We conducted an economic evaluation from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system based on trial data.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe primary outcome was an incremental cost utility analysis comparing costs and benefits associated with GDP vs DHAP. Resource utilization data were collected from 519 Canadian patients in the trial. Costs were presented in 2012 Canadian dollars and disaggregated to highlight the major cost drivers of care. Benefit was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on utilities translated from prospectively collected quality-of-life data. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nThe mean overall costs of treatment per patient in the GDP and DHAP arms were $19 961 (95% confidence interval (CI) = $17 286 to $24 565) and $34 425 (95% CI = $31 901 to $39 520), respectively, with an incremental difference in direct medical costs of $14 464 per patient in favor of GDP (P < .001). The predominant cost driver for both treatment arms was related to hospitalizations. The mean discounted quality-adjusted overall survival with GDP was 0.161 QALYs and 0.152 QALYs for DHAP (difference = 0.01 QALYs, P = .146). In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, GDP was associated with both cost savings and improved quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in 92.6% of cost-pair simulations.\n\n\nConclusions:\nGDP was associated with both lower costs and similar quality-adjusted outcomes compared with DHAP in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Considering both costs and outcomes, GDP was the dominant therapy.\n",

We evaluated the chemopreventive and therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action of 4-MU.\n\n\nMethods:\nTRAMP mice (7&ndash;28 per group) were gavaged with 4-MU (450mg/kg/day) in a stage-specific treatment design (8&ndash;28, 12&ndash;28, 22&ndash;28 weeks). Efficacy of 4-MU (200&ndash;450mg/kg/day) was also evaluated in the PC3-ML/Luc+ intracardiac injection and DU145 subcutaneous models. PCa cells and tissues were analyzed for HA and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt signaling and apoptosis effectors. HA add-back and myristoylated Akt (mAkt) overexpression studies evaluated the mechanism of action of 4-MU. Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and unpaired t test or Tukey&rsquo;s multiple comparison test. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nWhile vehicle-treated transgenic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (TRAMP) mice developed prostate tumors and metastases at 28 weeks, both were abrogated in treatment groups, without serum/organ toxicity or weight loss; no tumors developed at one year, even after stopping the treatment at 28 weeks. 4-MU did not alter the transgene or neuroendocrine marker expression but downregulated HA levels. However, 4-MU decreased microvessel density and proliferative index (P < .0001,). 4-MU completely prevented/inhibited skeletal metastasis in the PC3-ML/Luc+ model and DU145-tumor growth (85&ndash;90% inhibition, P = .002). 4-MU also statistically significantly downregulated HA receptors, PI-3K/CD44 complex and activity, Akt signaling, and &beta;-catenin levels/activation, but upregulated GSK-3 function, E-cadherin, and apoptosis effectors (P < .001); HA addition or mAkt overexpression rescued these effects.\n\n\nConclusion:\n4-MU is an effective nontoxic, oral chemopreventive, and therapeutic agent that targets PCa development, growth, and metastasis by abrogating HA signaling.\n",

Retrospective studies using cryopreserved serum suggest that four kallikrein markers can predict biopsy outcome.\n\n\nMethods:\nFree, intact and total PSA, and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 were measured in cryopreserved blood from 6129 men with elevated PSA (&ge;3.0ng/mL) participating in the prospective, randomized trial Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment. Marker levels from 4765 men providing anticoagulated plasma were incorporated into statistical models to predict any-grade and high-grade (Gleason score &ge;7) prostate cancer at 10-core biopsy. The models were corrected for optimism by 10-fold cross validation and independently validated using markers measured in serum from 1364 men. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nThe four kallikreins enhanced prostate cancer detection compared with PSA and age alone. Area under the curve (AUC) for the four kallikreins was 0.719 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.704 to 0.734) vs 0.634 (95% CI = 0.617 to 0.651, P < .001) for PSA and age alone for any-grade cancer, and 0.820 (95% CI = 0.802 to 0.838) vs 0.738 (95% CI = 0.716 to 0.761) for high-grade cancer. Using a 6% risk of high-grade cancer as an illustrative cutoff, for 1000 biopsied men with PSA levels of 3.0ng/mL or higher, the model would reduce the need for biopsy in 428 men, detect 119 high-grade cancers, and delay diagnosis of 14 of 133 high-grade cancers. Models exhibited excellent discrimination on independent validation among men with only serum samples available for analysis.\n\n\nConclusions:\nA statistical model based on kallikrein markers was validated in a large prospective study and reduces unnecessary biopsies while delaying diagnosis of high-grade cancers in few men.\n",

                "abstract": "T cell development and maturation involve a variety of defined and coordinated developmental stages under the control of a variety of signaling networks. They function as the major mediator in cell-based immunity that defends against pathogen infections and executes immune surveillance against tumor cells. Protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt) is central to multiple signaling pathways and transduces extracellular signals to dictate cellular responses towards proliferation, migration, anti-apoptosis, and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. Although the prosurvival function of PKB was thought to be responsible for most of the functions regulated by PKB, emerging evidence has started to dissect its role in immunomodulation. More importantly, hyperactivation of PKB in cancer stroma frequently occurs in patients treated clinically with targeted cancer therapies, where it acts as a key mediator involved in the trapping of host immune cells in the vicinity of tumors, which supports cancer cell invasion and the escape of cancer cells from host immune surveillance. Encouragingly, recent studies have shown that inhibition of PKB improves the recognition of cancer cells by the host immune system, indicating a potential clinical strategy to rekindle the suppressed host immune response through the specific targeting of PKB. In this review, we explore how PKB signaling contributes to T cell development and cellular immune responses and discuss the mechanistic roles that PKB plays in the creation of immunosuppressive conditions and the escaping of immune recognition in the microenvironment of cancer.",

Specifically, the importance of exfoliation of endometrial carcinoma cells through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneum is ill defined. We assessed the hypothesis that tubal ligation (TL), which should impede transtubal passage of cells, is associated with lower endometrial carcinoma stage at presentation and, consequently, lower mortality.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nThe NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 210 Trial included 4489 endometrial carcinoma patients who completed a risk factor questionnaire that included TL history. Pathology data were derived from clinical reports and central review. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between TL with stage and peritoneal metastasis, overall and by tumor subtype. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for TL and mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nCompared with stage I, TL was inversely associated with stage III (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.78) and stage IV carcinomas (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.24) overall and among individual tumor subtypes. TL was inversely related to peritoneal metastasis overall (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.68) and among serous carcinomas (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.68). In multivariable models unadjusted for stage, TL was associated with lower endometrial carcinoma-specific mortality (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.91); however, adjustment for stage eliminated the survival advantage. Similar relationships with all-cause mortality were observed.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nTL is associated with lower stage and mortality among women with aggressive endometrial carcinomas, suggesting transtubal spread is clinically important.

We sought to examine differences in cancer-specific survival between whites and Asian Americans.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to identify patients with lung (n = 130 852 [16.9%]), breast (n = 313 977 [40.4%]), prostate (n = 166 529 [21.4%]), or colorectal (n = 165 140 [21.3%]) cancer (the three leading causes of cancer-related mortality within each sex) diagnosed between 1991 and 2007.

Amino acids Asp 538, Tyr 537, and Asp 351 are known to play a role in either the turnover of ER, the antiestrogenic activity of the ER complex, or the estrogen-like actions of selective ER modulators. A unifying mechanism of action for these amino acids to enhance ER gene activation and growth response is presented. There is a range of mutations described in metastases vs low to zero in primary disease, so the new knowledge is of clinical relevance, thereby confirming an additional mechanism of acquired resistance to antihormone therapy through cell population selection pressure and enrichment during treatment.

Among children, incidence rates continued to increase by 0.8% per year over the past decade while, like adults, mortality declined. HR+/HER2- breast cancers, the subtype with the best prognosis, were the most common for all races/ethnicities with highest rates among non-Hispanic white women, local stage cases, and low poverty areas (92.7, 63.51, and 98.69 per 100000 non-Hispanic white women, respectively). HR+/HER2- breast cancer incidence rates were strongly, positively correlated with mammography use, particularly for non-Hispanic white women (Pearson 0.57, two-sided P < .001). Triple-negative breast cancers, the subtype with the worst prognosis, were highest among non-Hispanic black women (27.2 per 100000 non-Hispanic black women), which is reflected in high rates in southeastern states.\n\n\nConclusions:\nProgress continues in reducing the burden of cancer in the United States. There are unique racial/ethnic-specific incidence patterns for breast cancer subtypes; likely because of both biologic and social risk factors, including variation in mammography use. Breast cancer subtype analysis confirms the capacity of cancer registries to adjust national collection standards to produce clinically relevant data based on evolving medical knowledge.\n",

                "abstract": "Circulating T cells that specifically target normal self-proteins expressed by regulatory immune cells were first described in patients with cancer, but can also be detected in healthy individuals. The adaptive immune system is distinguished for its ability to differentiate between self-antigens and foreign antigens. Thus, it was remarkable to discover T cells that apparently lacked tolerance to important self-proteins, eg, IDO, PD-L1, and FoxP3, expressed in regulatory immune cells. The ability of self-reactive T cells to react to and eliminate regulatory immune cells can influence general immune reactions. This suggests that they may be involved in immune homeostasis. It is here proposed that these T cells should be termed antiregulatory T cells (anti-Tregs). The role of anti-Tregs in immune-regulatory networks may be diverse. For example, pro-inflammatory self-reactive T cells that react to regulatory immune cells may enhance local inflammation and inhibit local immune suppression. Further exploration is warranted to investigate their potential role under different malignant conditions and the therapeutic possibilities they possess. Utilizing anti-Tregs for anticancer immunotherapy implies the direct targeting of cancer cells in addition to regulatory immune cells. Anti-Tregs provide the immune system with yet another level of immune regulation and contradict the notion that immune cells involved in the adjustment of immune responses only act as suppressor cells.",

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nMenarche is a critical time point for diverging fates of mammary cells of origin. African American women have young age at menarche, which could be associated with their high rates of estrogen receptor&ndash;negative (ER-) breast cancer.\n\n\nMethods:\nIn the AMBER Consortium, using harmonized data from 4426 African American women with breast cancer and 17 474 controls, we used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ages at menarche and first live birth (FLB), and the interval between, in relation to ER+ and ER- breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nRisk of ER- breast cancer was reduced with later age at menarche among both parous and nulliparous women (&ge;15 vs <11 years OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.81 and OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.29 to 1.10, respectively), with no effect of age at FLB. For ER+ breast cancer, the inverse association was weaker among nulliparous women. While longer intervals between menarche and FLB were associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer in a dose-response fashion (OR for 20 year interval = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.79, P   trend = .003), ER- risk was only increased for intervals up to 14 years and not beyond (P   trend = .33).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWhile ER- breast cancer risk was markedly reduced in women with a late age at menarche, there was not a clear pattern of increased risk with longer interval between menarche and FLB, as was observed for ER+ breast cancer. These findings indicate that etiologic pathways involving adolescence and pregnancy may differ for ER- and ER+ breast cancer.\n",

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nThe E2F members have been divided into transcription activators (E2F1-E2F3) and repressors (E2F4-E2F8). E2F8 with E2F7 has been known to play an important physiologic role in embryonic development and cell cycle regulation by repressing E2F1. However, the function of E2F8 in cancer cells is unknown.\n\n\nMethods:\nE2F8 expression was assessed by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence staining in human lung cancer (LC) cells and tissues from LC patients (n = 45). Cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion analysis were performed to evaluate the role of E2F8 in LC. Microarray analysis was used to determine the target genes of E2F8. The regulation of E2F8 on the expression of ubiquitin-like PHD and RING domain-containing 1 (UHRF1), one of E2F8 target genes, was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter activity assays. Human LC xenograft models were used to determine the effects of inhibiting E2F8 by siRNAs (n = 7 per group) or antisense morpholino (n = 8 per group) on tumor growth. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and group differences by the Student&rsquo;s t test. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nLC tumors overexpressed E2F8 compared with normal lung tissues. Depletion of E2F8 inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth. E2F8 knockdown statistically significantly reduced the expression of UHRF1 (~60%-70%, P < .001), and the direct binding of E2F8 on the promoter of UHRF1 was identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis with a public database showed prognostic significance of aberrant E2F8 expression in LC (HR = 1.91 95% CI = 1.21 to 3.01 in chemo-na&iuml;ve patients, P = .0047).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWe demonstrated that E2F8 is overexpressed in LC and is required for the growth of LC cells. These findings implicate E2F8 as a novel therapeutic target for LC treatment.\n",

                "abstract": "\nBackground:\nDiagnosis of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) remains a bottleneck to conducting effective clinical trials for this aggressive subtype. We postulated that elevated expression of Forkhead Box transcription factor C1 (FOXC1) is a simple and accurate diagnostic biomarker for BLBC.\n\n\nMethods:\nAccuracy of FOXC1 expression in identifying BLBC was compared with the PAM50 gene expression panel in gene expression microarray (GEM) (n = 1992) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (n = 349) datasets. A FOXC1-based immunohistochemical (IHC) assay was developed and assessed in 96 archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer samples that also underwent PAM50 profiling. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nA FOXC1-based two-tier assay (IHC +/- qRT-PCR) accurately identified BLBC (AUC = 0.88) in an independent cohort of FFPE samples, validating the accuracy of FOXC1-defined BLBC in GEM (AUC = 0.90) and qRT-PCR (AUC = 0.88) studies, when compared with platform-specific PAM50-defined BLBC. The hazard ratio (HR) for disease-specific survival in patients having FOXC1-defined BLBC was 1.71 (95% CI = 1.31 to 2.23, P < .001), comparable to PAM50 assay-defined BLBC (HR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.40 to 2.17, P < .001). FOXC1 expression also predicted the development of brain metastasis. Importantly, unlike triple-negative or Core Basal IHC definitions, a FOXC1-based definition is able to identify BLBC in both ER+ and HER2+ patients.\n\n\nConclusion:\nA FOXC1-based two-tier assay, by virtue of being rapid, simple, accurate, and cost-effective may emerge as the diagnostic assay of choice for BLBC. Such a test could substantially improve clinical trial enrichment of BLBC patients and accelerate the identification of effective chemotherapeutic options for this aggressive disease.\n",

This study describes a novel approach that aims to disrupt the process of metastasis by interfering with this intense dialogue.\n\n\nMethods:\nProteomics and adhesion assays identified exosomes purified from the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients (n = 9) as intermediaries of tumor cell attachment. A novel tumor cell capture device was fabricated by embedding exosomes onto a 3D scaffold (metastatic trap [M-Trap]). Murine models of ovarian metastasis (n = 3 to 34 mice per group) were used to demonstrate the efficacy of M-Trap to capture metastatic cells disseminating in the peritoneal cavity. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate cumulative survival probabilities. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults:\nThe exosome-based M-Trap device promoted tumor cell adhesion with a nonpharmacological mode of action. M-Trap served as a preferential site for metastasis formation and completely remodeled the pattern of peritoneal metastasis in clinically relevant models of ovarian cancer. Most importantly, M-Trap demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in survival outcomes, with mean survival increasing from 117.5 to 198.8 days in the presence of M-Trap; removal of the device upon tumor cell capture further improved survival to a mean of 309.4 days (P < .001).\n\n\nConclusions:\nA potent artificial premetastatic niche based on exosomes is an effective approach to impair the crosstalk between metastatic cells and their environment. In the clinical setting, the capacity to modulate the pattern of dissemination represents an opportunity to control the process of metastasis. In summary, M-Trap transforms a systemic, fatal disease into a focalized disease where proven therapeutic approaches such as surgery can extend survival.\n",

We describe a new method to quantify ICD and ECD expression separately and assess the prognostic value of domain-specific HER2 results in patients who received adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nWe measured HER2 protein expression with quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in tissue microarrays (TMA) using two different antibodies targeting the ICD (CB11 and A0485) and ECD (SP3 and D8F12). We assessed the prognostic value of ICD and ECD expression in 180 patients from a clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab (HeCOG 10/05). We performed an exploratory univariate domain-specific, disease-free survival (DFS) analysis and compared DFS functions with Kaplan-Meier estimates. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nHER2 ICD expression by QIF showed slightly higher sensitivity to predict ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification than ECD expression, which was more specific and had higher positive predictive value. In the HeCOG 10/05 trial specimens, 15% of cases showed discordant results for ICD and ECD expression. High ECD was statistically associated with longer DFS (log-rank P = .049, HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.144 to 0.997), while ICD status was not. Among patients with low ECD, there was no difference in DFS by ICD status. However, when ICD was high, high ECD was statistically associated with longer DFS (log-rank P = .027, HR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.037 to 0.82) compared with low ECD.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nConclusion:<br>\nQuantitative measurements of HER2 ICD and ECD expression in breast cancer suggest a subclassification of HER2-positive tumors. Trastuzumab-treated patients with high ECD showed better DFS than patients with low ECD. This suggests differential benefit from trastuzumab therapy based on HER2 ECD expression.<br>\n",

We examined potential improvements in access to insurance for cancer survivors through adult Medicaid expansions and premium tax credits in the new insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMethods:<br>\nEligibility for Medicaid and premium tax credits was simulated for cancer survivors age 18 to 64 years in the 2008 to 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey using a detailed deterministic model. Financial hardship was determined as: 1) delays or unmet need for medical, prescription, or dental care because of cost or insurance issues and/or 2) family out-of-pocket medical spending that was 20% or more of gross income. Descriptive analyses were stratified by whether the state of residence chose to expand Medicaid by January 2015. All statistical tests were two-sided.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nResults:<br>\nOverall, 14.7% of 9.44 million cancer survivors were uninsured, with 18% reporting financial hardship. Under the ACA, 19% overall, 30% of the uninsured, and 39% of those reporting financial hardship would be Medicaid eligible. An additional 10% would be eligible for premium tax credits, with the remainder able to participate in the Marketplace without tax credits.

                "abstract": "Background:<br>\nDefects in programmed cell death, or apoptosis, are a hallmark of cancer. The anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family proteins, including BCL-2, BCL-X<br>\n                      L<br>\n                   , and MCL-1 have been characterized as key survival factors in multiple cancer types. Because cancer types with BCL2 and MCL1 amplification are more prone to inhibition of their respectively encoded proteins, we hypothesized that cancers with a significant frequency of BCL2L1 amplification would have greater dependency on BCL-X<br>\n                      L <br>\n                   for survival.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nTo identify tumor subtypes that have significant frequency of BCL2L1 amplification, we performed data mining using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.

                "abstract": "Background:<br>\nClinical trials designed to test the efficacy of retinoic acid (RA) as an adjuvant for the treatment of solid cancers have been disappointing, primarily due to RA resistance. Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells are more resistant to RA than ER-positive cells. The expression and subcellular distribution of two RA-binding proteins, FABP5 and CRABP2, has already been shown to play critical roles in breast cancer cell response to RA. CRABP1, a third member of the RA-binding protein family, has not previously been investigated as a possible mediator of RA action in breast cancer.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nCRABP1 and CRABP2 expression in primary breast tumor tissues was analyzed using gene expression and tissue microarrays. CRABP1 levels were manipulated using siRNAs and by transient overexpression. RA-induced subcellular translocation of CRABPs was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. RA-induced transactivation of RAR was analyzed using a RA response element (RARE)-driven luciferase reporter system. Effects of CRABP1 expression and RA treatment on downstream gene expression were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis.<br>\nResults:<br>\nCompared to normal mammary tissues, CRABP1 expression is significantly down-regulated in ER+ breast tumors, but maintained in triple-negative breast cancers. Elevated CRABP1 levels are associated with poor patient prognosis, high Ki67 immunoreactivity and high tumor grade in breast cancer. The prognostic significance of CRABP1 is attributed to its cytoplasmic localization. We demonstrate that CRABP1 expression attenuates RA-induced cell growth arrest and inhibits RA signalling in breast cancer cells by sequestering RA in the cytoplasm. We also show that CRABP1 affects the expression of genes involved in RA biosynthesis, trafficking and metabolism.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nCRABP1 is an adverse factor for clinical outcome in triple-negative breast cancer and a potent inhibitor of RA signalling in breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that CRABP1, in conjunction with previously identified CRABP2 and FABP5, plays a key role in breast cancer cell response to RA. We propose that these three RA-binding proteins can serve as biomarkers for predicting triple-negative breast cancer response to RA, with elevated levels of either cytoplasmic CRABP1 or FABP5 associated with RA resistance, and elevated levels of nuclear CRABP2 associated with sensitivity to RA.",

The limited survival benefit associated with the quick emergence of resistance and systemic toxicity diminished its efficacy. JNK-mediated apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of docetaxel activity whereas ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling is implicated in the development of resistance and induction of migration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the combination treatment with docetaxel and GLIPR1-\u0394TM will synergistically induce greater cell death and inhibit the emergence of resistance and development of metastatic potential in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.<br>\nMethods:<br>\nThe synergistic effects of the docetaxel and GLIPR1-\u0394TM were evaluated with DNA fragmentation, DAPI staining and MTS using paired t-test and isobologram study. The effects of the drugs on JNK and ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling were evaluated with Western blot, DNA fragmentation, and MTS assays using the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and CXCR4 siRNA. The results of docetaxel and GLIPR1-\u0394TM combination on migration were examined with scratch assay using the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 while our hypothesis was examined in vivo using VCaP orthotopic xenograft model.<br>\nResults:<br>\nWe found that GLIPR1-\u0394\u03a4\u039c synergized with docetaxel to induce apoptosis in VCaP and PC-3 PCa cells through induction of JNK signaling and concomitant inhibition of ERK1/2-c-Myc-CXCR4 signaling.

Let-7, one of the most well-known tumor suppressors, is frequently down-regulated in a variety of human cancers. The RBP LIN28A/LIN28B, a direct target of the let-7 family of miRNAs, is an inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis and is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Aberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors is reportedly involved in cancer development, contributing to cellular proliferation, cell death resistance, angiogenesis, metastasis, metabolism reprogramming, tumor-associated inflammation, genome instability, acquiring immortality and evading immune destruction.

Effects on actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, migration, and invasion of GBM cells were examined. To gain insight into molecular basis of the mTORC2 effects on cellular cytoskeletal arrangement and motility/invasion, we affinity purified mTORC2 from GBM cells and identified proteins of interest by mass spectrometry. Characterization of the protein of interest was performed.<br>\nResults:<br>\nIn addition to the inhibition of mTORC2 activity, we demonstrated significant alteration of actin distribution as revealed by the use of phalloidin staining. Furthermore, vinculin staining was altered which suggests changes in focal adhesion. Inhibition of cell migration and invasion was observed with PP242. Two major proteins that are associated with this mTORC2 multiprotein complex were found. Mass spectrometry identified one of them as Filamin A (FLNA). Association of FLNA with RICTOR but not mTOR was demonstrated. Moreover, in vitro, purified mTORC2 can phosphorylate FLNA likewise its known substrate, AKT. In GBM cells, colocalization of FLNA with RICTOR was observed, and the overall amounts of FLNA protein as well as phosphorylated FLNA are high. Upon treatments of RICTOR siRNA or PP242, phosphorylated FLNA levels at the regulatory residue (Ser2152) decreased. This treatment also disrupted colocalization of Actin filaments and FLNA.<br>\nConclusions:<br>\nOur results support FLNA as a new downstream effector of mTORC2 controlling GBM cell motility. This new mTORC2-FLNA signaling pathway plays important roles in motility and invasion of glioblastoma cells.",

LC3-GFP, Acridine orange assay and transmission electron microscopy even confirmed the increased autophagosome formations in treated cells. Bergapten-induced autophagy is dependent by PTEN up-regulation, since silencing this gene, the induction of Beclin1 and the p-AKT/p-mTOR signal down-regulation were reversed.

Cell cycle analysis and antibody blocking methods were employed to assay cell proliferation and cell attachment, respectively. Electron microscopy and transepthelial electrical resistance measurement were performed to examine the TJ ultrastructure and barrier function. Co-immunolocalization and co-immunoprecipitation was used to study claudin-7 interaction with integrin \u03b21. Tumor growth in vivo were analyzed using athymic nude mice.<br>\nResults:<br>\nClaudin-7 co-localizes and forms a stable complex with integrin \u03b21. Both suppressing claudin-7 expression by lentivirus shRNA in human lung cancer cells (KD cells) and deletion of claudin-7 in mouse lungs lead to the reduction in integrin \u03b21 and phospho-FAK levels. Suppressing claudin-7 expression increases cell growth and cell cycle progression. More significantly, claudin-7 KD cells have severe defects in cell-matrix interactions and adhere poorly to culture plates with a remarkably reduced integrin \u03b21 expression. When cultured on uncoated glass coverslips, claudin-7 KD cells grow on top of each other and form spheroids while the control cells adhere well and grow as a monolayer. Reintroducing claudin-7 reduces cell proliferation, upregulates integrin \u03b21 expression and increases cell-matrix adhesion. Integrin \u03b21 transfection partially rescues the cell attachment defect.

                "abstract": "Here, evidence suggests that nitric oxide synthases (NOS) of tumor cells, in contrast with normal tissues, synthesize predominantly superoxide and peroxynitrite. Based on high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, the underlying mechanism for this uncoupling is a reduced tetrahydrobiopterin:dihydrobiopterin ratio (BH4:BH2) found in breast, colorectal, epidermoid, and head and neck tumors compared with normal tissues. Increasing BH4:BH2 and reconstitution of coupled NOS activity in breast cancer cells with the BH4 salvage pathway precursor, sepiapterin, causes significant shifts in downstream signaling, including increased cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity, decreased &beta;-catenin expression, and TCF4 promoter activity, and reduced NF-B promoter activity. Sepiapterin inhibited breast tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo as measured by a clonogenic assay, Ki67 staining, and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose&ndash;deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). In summary, using diverse tumor types, it is demonstrated that the BH4:BH2 ratio is lower in tumor tissues and, as a consequence, NOS activity generates more peroxynitrite and superoxide anion than nitric oxide, resulting in important tumor growth&ndash;promoting and antiapoptotic signaling properties.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: The synthetic BH4, Kuvan, is used to elevate BH4:BH2 in some phenylketonuria patients and to treat diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction, suggesting a novel, testable approach for correcting an abnormality of tumor metabolism to control tumor growth.

Here, the clinicopathologic and molecular features of AKT1 E17K&ndash;mutated colorectal carcinoma in comparison with PIK3CA-mutated colorectal carcinoma are described in detail. Interestingly, in comparison with PIK3CA mutants, AKT1 E17K was significantly associated with mucinous morphology and concurrent BRAF V600E mutation. Among PIK3CA mutants, exon 21 mutations were significantly associated with BRAF V600E mutation, MSI-H status, and poor differentiation, while exon 10 mutations were associated with KRAS/NRAS mutations. Three of four AKT1 mutants with data from both primary and metastatic lesions had concordant AKT1 mutation status in both. Both AKT1- and PIK3CA-mutant colorectal carcinoma demonstrated frequent loss of PTEN expression (38% and 34%, respectively) and similar rates of p-PRAS 40 expression (63% and 50%, respectively). Both patients with AKT1 E17K alone had primary resistance to cetuximab, whereas 7 of 8 patients with PIK3CA mutation alone experienced tumor shrinkage or stability with anti-EGFR therapy. These results demonstrate that AKT1 E17K mutation in advanced colorectal carcinoma is associated with mucinous morphology, PIK3CA wild-type status, and concurrent RAS/RAF mutations with similar pattern to PIK3CA exon 21 mutants. Thus, AKT1 E17K mutations contribute to primary resistance to cetuximab and serve as an actionable alteration.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: This first systematic study of AKT1 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations and their association with cetuximab resistance and BRAF V600E mutation has important ramifications for the development of personalized medicine, particularly in identifying patient candidates for PI3K or AKT inhibitors.

OSCC is on the rise worldwide, and death rates associated with the disease are particularly high. Despite progress in understanding the mutational and expression landscape associated with OSCC, advances in deciphering these alterations for the development of therapeutic strategies have been limited. Further insight into the molecular cues that contribute to OSCC is therefore required. Here, we show that the transcriptional regulators YAP (YAP1) and TAZ (WWTR1), which are key effectors of the Hippo pathway, drive protumorigenic signals in OSCC. Regions of premalignant oral tissues exhibit aberrant nuclear YAP accumulation, suggesting that dysregulated YAP activity contributes to the onset of OSCC. Supporting this premise, we determined that nuclear YAP and TAZ activity drives OSCC cell proliferation, survival, and migration in vitro, and is required for OSCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Global gene expression profiles associated with YAP and TAZ knockdown revealed changes in the control of gene expression implicated in protumorigenic signaling, including those required for cell cycle progression and survival. Notably, the transcriptional signature regulated by YAP and TAZ significantly correlates with gene expression changes occurring in human OSCCs identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), emphasizing a central role for YAP and TAZ in OSCC biology.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: This study defines a YAP/TAZ-regulated transcriptional program in OSCC and reveals novel roles for nuclear YAP/TAZ activity in the onset and progression of this cancer.

Previously, it was shown that COX-2 expression promotes breast cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including induction of stem-like cells (SLC), owing to activation of the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 (PTGER4). COX-2 overexpression also upregulated microRNA-526b (miR-526b), in association with aggressive phenotype. Here, the functional roles of miR-526b in breast cancer and the mechanistic role of EP4 signaling in miR-526b upregulation were examined. A positive correlation was noted between miR-526b and COX-2 mRNA expression in COX-2 disparate breast cancer cell lines. Stable overexpression of miR-526b in poorly metastatic MCF7 and SKBR3 cell lines resulted in increased cellular migration, invasion, EMT phenotype and enhanced tumorsphere formation in vitro, and lung colony formation in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Conversely, knockdown of miR-526b in aggressive MCF7-COX-2 and SKBR3-COX-2 cells reduced oncogenic functions and reversed the EMT phenotype, in vitro. Furthermore, it was determined that miR-526b expression is dependent on EP4 receptor activity and downstream PI3K&ndash;AKT and cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways. PI3K&ndash;AKT inhibitors blocked EP4 agonist&ndash;mediated miR-526b upregulation and tumorsphere formation in MCF7 and SKBR3 cells. NF-B inhibitor abrogates EP agonist&ndash;stimulated miRNA expression in MCF7 and T47D cells, indicating that the NF-B pathway is also involved in miR-526b regulation. In addition, inhibition of COX-2, EP4, PI3K, and PKA in COX-2&ndash;overexpressing cells downregulated miR-526b and its functions in vitro. Finally, miR-526b expression was significantly higher in cancerous than in noncancerous breast tissues and associated with reduced patient survival. In conclusion, miR-526b promotes breast cancer progression, SLC-phenotype through EP4-mediated signaling, and correlates with breast cancer patient survival.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: This study presents novel findings that miRNA 526b is a COX-2 upregulated, oncogenic miRNA promoting SLCs, the expression of which follows EP4 receptor-mediated signaling, and is a promising biomarker for monitoring and personalizing breast cancer therapy.

MicroRNA 21-5p (miR-21) has been shown to be upregulated in HCC, but the contribution of this oncomiR to the maintenance of tumorigenic phenotype in liver cancer remains poorly understood. We have developed potent and specific single-stranded oligonucleotide inhibitors of miR-21 (anti-miRNAs) and used them to interrogate dependency on miR-21 in a panel of liver cancer cell lines. Treatment with anti&ndash;miR-21, but not with a mismatch control anti-miRNA, resulted in significant derepression of direct targets of miR-21 and led to loss of viability in the majority of HCC cell lines tested. Robust induction of caspase activity, apoptosis, and necrosis was noted in anti&ndash;miR-21-treated HCC cells. Furthermore, ablation of miR-21 activity resulted in inhibition of HCC cell migration and suppression of clonogenic growth. To better understand the consequences of miR-21 suppression, global gene expression profiling was performed on anti&ndash;miR-21-treated liver cancer cells, which revealed striking enrichment in miR-21 target genes and deregulation of multiple growth-promoting pathways. Finally, in vivo dependency on miR-21 was observed in two separate HCC tumor xenograft models. In summary, these data establish a clear role for miR-21 in the maintenance of tumorigenic phenotype in HCC in vitro and in vivo.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: miR-21 is important for the maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype of HCC and represents a target for pharmacologic intervention.

However, EGFR is frequently activated in a subset of TNBCs and represents a viable clinical target. Because the endocytic adaptor protein Endophilin A2 (SH3GL1/Endo II) has been implicated in EGFR internalization, we investigated Endo II expression and function in human TNBCs. Endo II expression was high in several TNBC cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells. Stable knockdown (KD) of Endo II was achieved in two TNBC cell lines, and although cell viability was unaffected, defects in receptor-mediated endocytosis were observed. EGFR signaling to Erk and Akt kinases was impaired in Endo II KD cells, and this correlated with reduced rates of EGFR internalization and cell motility. Endo II KD cells also displayed defects in three dimensional (3D) cell invasion, and this correlated with impaired extracellular matrix degradation and internalization of MT1-MMP. Endo II silencing also caused a significant reduction in TNBC tumor growth and lung metastasis in mammary orthotopic tumor xenograft assays. In human breast tumor specimens, Endo II expression was highest in TNBC tumors compared with other subtypes, and at the level of gene expression, high Endo II was associated with reduced relapse-free survival in patients with basal-like breast cancers. Together, these results identify a positive role for Endo II in TNBC tumor metastasis and a potential link with poor prognosis.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: Endophilin A2 and related adaptor proteins represent important signaling hubs to target in metastatic cancers.

To gain detailed insight into EphB1 function in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), comprehensive analysis of EphB1 transcriptional regulation was conducted. In AML cells, EphB1 transcript was inversely correlated with EphB1 promoter methylation. The presence of EphB1 allowed EfnB1 ligand&ndash;mediated p53 DNA binding, leading to restoration of the DNA damage response (DDR) cascade by the activation of ATR, Chk1, p53, p21, p38, CDK1tyr15, and Bax, and downregulation of HSP27 and Bcl2. Comparatively, reintroduction of EphB1 expression in EphB1-methylated AML cells enhanced the same cascade of ATR, Chk1, p21, and CDK1tyr15, which consequently enforced programmed cell death. Interestingly, in pediatric AML samples, EphB1 peptide phosphorylation and mRNA expression were actively suppressed as compared with normal bone marrow, and a significant percentage of the primary AML specimens had EphB1 promoter hypermethylation. Finally, EphB1 repression associated with a poor overall survival in pediatric AML. Combined, the contribution of EphB1 to the DDR system reveals a tumor-suppressor function for EphB1 in pediatric AML.<br>\n<br>\nImplications: The tumor-suppressor function of EphB1 is clinically relevant across many malignancies, suggesting that EphB1 is an important regulator of common cancer cell transforming pathways.

Animal models that more faithfully recapitulate genotype-specific human pathology could improve the predictive value of these investigations. Here, a newly identified animal model for oncogenic BRAF-driven cancers is described. With 20,000 new cases in the United States each year, canine invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (InvTCC) is a common, naturally occurring malignancy that shares significant histologic, biologic, and clinical phenotypes with human muscle invasive bladder cancer. In order to identify somatic drivers of canine InvTCC, the complete transcriptome for multiple tumors was determined by RNAseq. All tumors harbored a somatic mutation that is homologous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation, and an identical mutation was present in 87% of 62 additional canine InvTCC tumors. The mutation was also detectable in the urine sediments of all dogs tested with mutation-positive tumors. Functional experiments suggest that, like human tumors, canine activating BRAF mutations potently stimulate the MAPK pathway. Cell lines with the mutation have elevated levels of phosphorylated MEK, compared with a line with wild-type BRAF. This effect can be diminished through application of the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor vemurafenib. These findings set the stage for canine InvTCC as a powerful system to evaluate BRAF-targeted therapies, as well as therapies designed to overcome resistance, which could enhance treatment of both human and canine cancers<br>\n<br>\nImplications: This study demonstrates the activating BRAF mutation (V600E), which is found in multiple human cancers, is a driver of canine InvTCC, and highlights a urine-based test for quick diagnosis.

The central effector of canonical Wnt signaling, &beta;-catenin (CTNNB1), is a multifunctional protein, and has been extensively studied with respect to its roles in cell&ndash;cell adhesion and in regulation of Wnt-driven transcription. Here, a novel mass spectrometry&ndash;based proteomics technique in colorectal cancer cells expressing stabilized &beta;-catenin, was used to identify a protein&ndash;protein interaction between &beta;-catenin and DNA methyltransferase I (Dnmt1) protein, the primary regulator of DNA methylation patterns in mammalian cells. Dnmt1 and &beta;-catenin strongly colocalized in the nuclei of colorectal cancer cells, and the interaction is mediated by the central domain of the Dnmt1 protein. Dnmt1 protein abundance is dependent upon the levels of &beta;-catenin, and is increased in cells expressing stabilized mutant &beta;-catenin. Conversely, the Dnmt1 regulates the levels of nuclear &beta;-catenin and &beta;-catenin/TCF&ndash;driven transcription.

Our previous studies showed that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) reduces pancreatic cancer growth and progression, through blockage of the centrally important RAL effector pathway, downstream of KRAS. In the current study, the therapeutic effects of combining the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib (SCH727965; MK-7965) with the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 were evaluated using orthotopic and subcutaneous patient-derived human pancreatic cancer xenograft models. The combination of dinaciclib (20 mg/kg, i.p., three times a week) and MK-2206 (60 mg/kg, orally, three times a week) dramatically blocked tumor growth and metastasis in all eight pancreatic cancer models examined. Remarkably, several complete responses were induced by the combination treatment of dinaciclib and MK-2206. The striking results obtained in these models demonstrate that the combination of dinaciclib with the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 is promising for therapeutic evaluation in pancreatic cancer, and strongly suggest that blocking RAL in combination with other effector pathways downstream from KRAS may provide increased efficacy in pancreatic cancer.

As such, complementary therapeutic strategies are being explored to prevent relapse. The altered metabolic state of cancer cells, which perform aerobic glycolysis, represents an interesting target that can enable discrimination between healthy cells and cancer cells. We hypothesized that cosilencing of genes responsible for aerobic glycolysis and for MDR would have synergistic antitumor effect. In this study, siRNA duplexes against pyruvate kinase M2 and multidrug resistance gene-1 were encapsulated in hyaluronic acid&ndash;based self-assembling nanoparticles. The particles were characterized for morphology, size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, and transfection efficiency. In vivo studies included biodistribution assessment, gene knockdown confirmation, therapeutic efficacy, and safety analysis. The benefit of active targeting of cancer cells was confirmed by modifying the particles' surface with a peptide targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor, which is overexpressed on the membranes of the SKOV-3 cancer cells. To augment the studies involving transplantation of a paclitaxel-resistant cell line, an in vivo paclitaxel resistance model was developed by injecting repeated doses of paclitaxel following tumor inoculation. The nanoparticles accumulated significantly in the tumors, hindering tumor volume doubling time (P < 0.05) upon combination therapy in both the wild-type (2-fold) and resistant (8-fold) xenograft models. Although previous studies indicated that silencing of MDR-1 alone sensitized MDR ovarian cancer to paclitaxel only modestly, these data suggest that concurrent silencing of PKM-2 improves the efficacy of paclitaxel against MDR ovarian cancer.

It was previously reported that RhoA plays a critical role in angiogenesis by coordinating endothelial cell cytoskeleton remodeling and promoting endothelial cell motility. Although RhoA has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, little has been described regarding its control of these tumor cell&ndash;lined channels. In this study, we established an in vitro model of VM using 3-dimensional cell culturing of mouse B16 melanoma cells and studied VM in vivo by transplanting B16 cells into C57/BL mice. Next, we explored the effect of RhoA and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) on VM formation using the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil. We provide direct evidence that fasudil leads to reduced vascular-like channels in Matrigel. Additional experiments suggested that fasudil prevents both initial cellular architecture changes and cell migration in vitro. Finally, we provide in-depth evidence for the underlying mechanisms of fasudil-induced VM destruction using the Rho-GTPase agonist lysophosphatidic acid. In vivo studies revealed that fasudil reduced B16 melanoma cell xenograft tumor growth without causing significant toxicity in mice. Fasudil-treated tumors also displayed fewer VM channels.

                "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma is a transcription factor&ndash;mediated pediatric bone tumor caused by a chromosomal translocation of the EWSR1 gene and one of several genes in the ETS family of transcription factors, typically FLI1 or ERG. Full activity of the resulting oncogenic fusion protein occurs only after binding RNA helicase A (RHA), and novel biologically targeted small molecules designed to interfere with that interaction have shown early promise in the preclinical setting. Herein, we demonstrate marked preclinical antineoplastic activity of an orally bioavailable formulation of YK-4-279 and identify mechanisms of acquired chemotherapy resistance that may be exploited to induce collateral sensitivity. Daily enteral administration of YK-4-279 led to significant delay in Ewing sarcoma tumor growth within a murine model. In advance of anticipated early-phase human clinical trials, we investigated both de novo and acquired mechanism(s) by which Ewing sarcoma cells evade YK-4-279&ndash;mediated cell death. Drug-resistant clones, formed by chronic in vitro exposure to steadily increased levels of YK-4-279, overexpressed c-Kit, cyclin D1, pStat3(Y705), and PKC isoforms. Interestingly, cross-resistance to imatinib and enzastaurin (selective inhibitors of c-Kit and PKC-&beta;, respectively), was observed and the use of YK-4-279 with enzastaurin in vitro led to marked drug synergy, suggesting a potential role for combination therapies in the future. By advancing an oral formulation of YK-4-279 and identifying prominent mechanisms of resistance, this preclinical research takes us one step closer to a shared goal of curing adolescents and young adults afflicted by Ewing sarcoma.

Currently, retinoic acid therapy is used as maintenance treatment to induce differentiation and reduce tumor recurrence following induction therapy for neuroblastoma, but unavoidable side effects are seen. A novel retinoid, UAB30, has been shown to generate negligible toxicities. In the current study, we hypothesized that UAB30 would have a significant impact on multiple neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Cellular survival, cell-cycle analysis, migration, and invasion were studied using AlamarBlue assays, FACS, and Transwell assays, respectively, in multiple cell lines following treatment with UAB30. In addition, an in vivo murine model of human neuroblastoma was utilized to study the effects of UAB30 upon tumor xenograft growth and animal survival. We successfully demonstrated decreased cellular survival, invasion, and migration, cell-cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis after treatment with UAB30. Furthermore, inhibition of tumor growth and increased survival was observed in a murine neuroblastoma xenograft model. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies suggest a potential therapeutic role for the low toxicity synthetic retinoid X receptor selective agonist, UAB30, in neuroblastoma treatment.

Gemcitabine-based therapy is the standard treatment for pancreatic cancer but has limited efficacy due to chemoresistance. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of gemcitabine combined with the selective nuclear export (CRM1) inhibitor KPT-330 on pancreatic cancer growth. Human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 and metastatic pancreatic cancer L3.6pl cell lines were treated with different concentrations of KPT-330 and gemcitabine alone or in combination, and anchorage&ndash;dependent/independent growth was recorded. In addition, L3.6pl cells with luciferase were injected orthotopically into the pancreas of athymic nude mice, which were treated with (i) vehicle (PBS 1 mL/kg i.p., 2/week and povidone/pluronic F68 1 mL/kg p.o., 3/week), (ii) KPT-330 (20 mg/kg p.o., 3/week), (iii) gemcitabine (100 mg/kg i.p., 2/week), or (iv) KPT-330 (10 mg/kg) + gemcitabine (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. KPT-330 and gemcitabine alone dose-dependently inhibited anchorage-dependent growth in vitro and tumor volume in vivo compared with vehicle treatment. However, the combination inhibited growth synergistically. In combination, KPT-330 and gemcitabine acted synergistically to enhance pancreatic cancer cell death greater than each single-agent therapy. Mechanistically, KPT-330 and gemcitabine promoted apoptosis, induced p27, depleted survivin, and inhibited accumulation of DNA repair proteins. Together, our data suggest that KPT-330 potentiates the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in human pancreatic cancer through inhibition of tumor growth, depletion of the antiapoptotic proteins, and induction of apoptosis.

New molecularly directed therapies are under development. EGFR is one of the most promising targets, as this receptor is mutated and/or overexpressed in nearly half of the GBMs. However, the results obtained with first-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have been disappointing with no clear predictive markers of tumor response. Here, we have tested the antitumoral efficacy of a second-generation inhibitor, dacomitinib (PF299804, Pfizer), that binds in an irreversible way to the receptor. Our results confirm that dacomitinib has an effect on cell viability, self-renewal, and proliferation in EGFR-amplified &plusmn; EGFRvIII GBM cells. Moreover, systemic administration of dacomitinib strongly impaired the in vivo tumor growth rate of these EGFR-amplified cell lines, with a decrease in the expression of stem cell&ndash;related markers. However, continuous administration of the compound was required to maintain the antitumor effect. The data presented here confirm that dacomitinib clearly affects receptor signaling in vivo and that its strong antitumoral effect is independent of the presence of mutant receptor isoforms although it could be affected by the PTEN status (as it is less effective in a PTEN-deleted GBM line). Dacomitinib is being tested in second line for EGFR-amplified GBMs. We hope that our results could help to select retrospectively molecular determinants of this response and to implement future trials with dacomitinib (alone or in combination with other inhibitors) in newly diagnosed GBMs. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(7); 1548&ndash;58. &copy;2015 AACR.",

An emerging, though counterintuitive, therapeutic approach is inhibition of PP2A to drive damaged cells through the cell cycle, sensitizing them to radiotherapy. We investigated the effects of PP2A inhibition on U251 glioblastoma cells following radiation treatment in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Radiotherapy alone augmented PP2A activity, though this was significantly attenuated with combination LB100 treatment. LB100 treatment yielded a radiation dose enhancement factor of 1.45 and increased the rate of postradiation mitotic catastrophe at 72 and 96 hours. Glioblastoma cells treated with combination LB100 and radiotherapy maintained increased -H2AX expression at 24 hours, diminishing cellular repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Combination therapy significantly enhanced tumor growth delay and mouse survival and decreased p53 expression 3.68-fold, compared with radiotherapy alone. LB100 treatment effectively inhibited PP2A activity and enhanced U251 glioblastoma radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Combination treatment with LB100 and radiation significantly delayed tumor growth, prolonging survival. The mechanism of radiosensitization appears to be related to increased mitotic catastrophe, decreased capacity for repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and diminished p53 DNA-damage response pathway activity.

                "abstract": "Although EGFR is a validated therapeutic target across multiple cancer indications, the often modest clinical responses to current anti-EGFR agents suggest the need for improved therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that signal amplification driven by high-affinity EGFR ligands limits the capacity of monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies to block pathway signaling and cell proliferation and that these ligands are commonly coexpressed with low-affinity EGFR ligands in epithelial tumors. To develop an improved antibody therapeutic capable of overcoming high-affinity ligand-mediated signal amplification, we used a network biology approach comprised of signaling studies and computational modeling of receptor&ndash;antagonist interactions. Model simulations suggested that an oligoclonal antibody combination may overcome signal amplification within the EGFR:ERK pathway driven by all EGFR ligands. Based on this, we designed MM-151, a combination of three fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that can simultaneously engage distinct, nonoverlapping epitopes on EGFR with subnanomolar affinities. In signaling studies, MM-151 antagonized high-affinity EGFR ligands more effectively than cetuximab, leading to an approximately 65-fold greater decrease in signal amplification to ERK. In cell viability studies, MM-151 demonstrated antiproliferative activity against high-affinity EGFR ligands, either singly or in combination, while cetuximab activity was largely abrogated under these conditions. We confirmed this finding both in vitro and in vivo in a cell line model of autocrine high-affinity ligand expression. Together, these preclinical studies provide rationale for the clinical study of MM-151 and suggest that high-affinity EGFR ligand expression may be a predictive response marker that distinguishes MM-151 from other anti-EGFR therapeutics.

We generated neutralizing antibodies to myostatin to test their potential use as therapeutic agents to attenuate the skeletal muscle wasting due to cancer. We show that our neutralizing antimyostatin antibodies significantly increase body weight, skeletal muscle mass, and strength in non&ndash;tumor-bearing mice with a concomitant increase in mean myofiber area. The administration of these neutralizing antibodies in two preclinical models of cancer-induced muscle wasting (C26 colon adenocarcinoma and PC3 prostate carcinoma) resulted in a significant attenuation of the loss of muscle mass and strength with no effect on tumor growth. We also show that the skeletal muscle mass&ndash; and strength-preserving effect of the antibodies is not affected by the coadministration of gemcitabine, a common chemotherapeutic agent, in both non&ndash;tumor-bearing mice and mice bearing C26 tumors.

In addition, ARHGEF5 mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Furthermore, ARHGEF5 long and short isoform coexpression was detected by immunofluorescence. Finally, flow cytometry; CCK8 and wound-healing assays; cell invasion, migration and adhesion; and xenografts were used to evaluate the biologic significance of ARHGEF5. ARHGEF5 was significantly increased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. Interestingly, ARHGEF5 levels were significantly associated with tumor grade and pathologic stage, but not age, gender, T stage, or lymph node metastasis status.

The aurora kinases are frequently upregulated in human cancers and are associated with sensitivity to chemotherapy in certain ones. In the present study, we investigated whether aurora kinases could be a target to overcome radioresistance or enhance the radiosensitivity of lung cancer. For that purpose, we determined the therapeutic potential of daurinol, an investigational topoisomerase inhibitor, alone and in combination with radiation, by observing its effect on aurora kinases. Daurinol decreased cell viability and proliferation in human colon and lung cancer cells. Gene expression in daurinol-treated human colon cancer cells was evaluated using RNA microarray. The mRNA expression of 18 genes involved in the mitotic spindle check point, including aurora kinase A (AURKA) and aurora kinase B (AURKB), was decreased in daurinol-treated human colon cancer cells as compared with vehicle-treated cells. As expected, radiation increased expression levels of AURKA and AURKB. This increase was effectively attenuated by siRNAs against AURKA and AURKB, which suppressed cell growth and increased apoptosis under radiation. Furthermore, the expression of AURKA and AURKB was suppressed by daurinol in the presence or absence of radiation in colon and lung cancer cells. Daurinol alone or in combination with radiation decreased lung cancer growth in xenograft mouse models. Our data clearly confirm the antitumor and radiosensitizing activity of daurinol in human lung cancer cells through the inhibition of AURKA and AURKB.

Moreover, PTBP1 expression levels were positively correlated to poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis. In analyses of colorectal cancer cells using siRNA for PTBP1, we observed that PTBP1 affects cell invasion, which was partially correlated to CD44 splicing, and this correlation was also confirmed in clinical samples. PTBP1 expression also affected anchorage-independent growth in colorectal cancer cell lines. PTBP1 expression also affected cell proliferation.

The study of human cancer cell populations is difficult due to long requirements for tumor growth, interpatient variability, and the need for tumor growth in immune-deficient mice. We therefore characterized the cancer initiation capacity of distinct cancer cell populations in a transgenic murine model of ovarian cancer. In this model, conditional deletion of Apc, Pten, and Trp53 in the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) results in the generation of high-grade metastatic ovarian carcinomas. Cell lines derived from these murine tumors express numerous putative stem cell markers, including CD24, CD44, CD90, CD117, CD133, and ALDH. We show that CD24+ and CD133+ cells have increased tumor sphere-forming capacity.

No preferential tumor-initiating or growth capacity was observed for CD44+, CD90+, CD117+, or ALDH+ versus their negative counterparts.

However, despite their efficacy, resistance to these drugs can occur in some patients. The INrf2 (Keap1):Nrf2 complex serves as a sensor of drug/radiation-induced oxidative/electrophilic stress. INrf2 constitutively suppresses Nrf2 by functioning as an adapter protein for the Cul3/Rbx1-mediated ubiquitination/degradation of Nrf2. Upon stress, Nrf2 dissociates from INrf2, is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, and coordinately induces a battery of cytoprotective gene expression. Current studies investigated the role of Nrf2 in aromatase inhibitor resistance. RT-PCR and immunoblot assays showed that aromatase inhibitor&ndash;resistant breast cancer LTLTCa and AnaR cells express lower INrf2 and higher Nrf2 protein levels, as compared with drug-sensitive MCF-7Ca and AC1 cells, respectively. The increase in Nrf2 was due to lower ubiquitination/degradation of Nrf2 in aromatase inhibitor&ndash;resistant cells. Higher Nrf2-mediated levels of biotransformation enzymes, drug transporters, and antiapoptotic proteins contributed to reduced efficacy of drugs and aversion to apoptosis that led to drug resistance. shRNA inhibition of Nrf2 in LTLTCa (LTLTCa-Nrf2KD) cells reduced resistance and sensitized cells to aromatase inhibitor exemestane. Interestingly, LTLTCa-Nrf2KD cells also showed reduced levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase, a marker of tumor-initiating cells and significantly decreased mammosphere formation, as compared with LTLTCa-Vector control cells. The results together suggest that persistent aromatase inhibitor treatment downregulated INrf2 leading to higher expression of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective proteins that resulted in increased aromatase inhibitor drug resistance. These findings provide a rationale for the development of Nrf2 inhibitors to overcome resistance and increase efficacy of aromatase inhibitors.

In this study, we found that cambogin inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Cambogin induced the activation of the caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that the expression of proteins involving in the radical oxygen species (ROS) pathway was among the most affected upon cambogin treatment. Cambogin enhanced cellular ROS production, and induced the activation of the ASK1&ndash;MKK4/MKK7&ndash;JNK/SAPK signaling pathway. Pretreatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was able to restore cell viability in the presence of cambogin. Importantly, cambogin treatment led to the activation of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and the trimethylation of histone H3K9 in the activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding region of the Bcl-2 gene promoter.

                "abstract": "Genomic analyses of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have yet to yield significant strategies against pathway activation to improve treatment. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for SCC of different histotypes either as a single-agent or alongside other chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy; however, resistance inevitably emerges, which limits the duration of treatment response. To elucidate mechanisms that mediate resistance to cisplatin, we compared drug-induced perturbations to gene and protein expression between cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant SCC cells, and identified MAPK&ndash;ERK pathway upregulation and activation in drug-resistant cells. ERK-induced resistance appeared to be activated by Son of Sevenless (SOS) upstream, and mediated through Bim degradation downstream. Clinically, elevated p-ERK expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck SCC treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Inhibition of MEK/ERK, but not that of EGFR or RAF, augmented cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibition of the activated SOS&ndash;MAPK&ndash;ERK pathway may augment patient responses to cisplatin treatment.

These deficient interactions result from a perturbed GABA release by beta cells, unable to inhibit neighboring alpha and delta cells. Consequently, a hybrid catabolic-anabolic metabolism, mediated by glucagon and insulin takes place. The catabolic and anabolic hormones, act via kinases and phosphatases, on specific enzymatic switches, rewiring metabolic pathways, and give to mitotic cells a special advantage, leading to cancer. The pancreatic GABA starter hypothesis for cancer seems verified, on a large population of regular consumers of palm tree betel nuts. These nuts contain classical GABA inhibitors that affect pancreatic mechanisms; epidemiological studies on large populations of betel nut consumers clearly show an elevated cancer risk.\n<br>\n\tSince vitamin B6, is the cofactor of glutamatedecarboxylase, GABA synthesis should decrease in processes de-activating vitamin B6, increasing cancer risk. Gyromitrin a hydrazine found in a consumed mushroom (Gyromitra esculenta) forms vitamin B6-hydrazones de-activating the vitamin; gyrometrin was clearly carcinogenic in rodents. Pathologies de-activating vitamin B6 include Pellagra, a niacin deficiency due to maize diet; there, amines form adducts with vitamin B6 and might increase cancer risk. Another identified adduct, is a vitamin B6-pyrrole compound found in Prolinemia type II. Thus, for the carcinogenic pyrrolizidines contained in boraginaceae and other plant families, pyrroles resulting from the degradation of pyrrolizidines, should form pyrrole-vitamin B6, adducts, explaining their carcinogenicity. This is applicable to other pyrrole containing drugs, and to diseases with pyrroluria. Moreover, vitamin B6 supplementation seems to prevent cancer.",

Most research in this area is specific to breast and prostate cancer, although recent literature is focusing on other tumour types.Of recent interest is the immunological response of exercise in cancer survivors, both on and off treatment. The cytokine cascade in response to exercise differs from that induced by infection, which leads to the question of how exercise impacts those who are immuno-compromised.

Some studies, however, have demonstrated inconclusive results, which may be complicated by inadequate study design to account for baseline Vitamin D status or deficiencies, and also by tumor-specific up-regulation of the vitamin D catabolism enzyme, cytochrome p450 24 (CYP24), or mutations in the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), which have been observed in some oral cancers.&nbsp; Conclusions: This comprehensive analysis of research regarding Vitamin D status, intake, and metabolism suggests oral cancer risk may, in fact, be more interconnected than previously acknowledged.

                "abstract": "Purpose: There is growing recognition that patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment tools are important components in the holistic clinical management of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Single administration of such tools can provide insight into the incidence and prevalence of the many multifaceted and debilitating functional deficits experienced by this population, while routine screening using PROs can assist in the early detection of&nbsp; &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; patients and serve as a process for monitoring functional status over time. To assist the implementation of routine PRO screening in clinical practice, an emerging body of literature has begun to explore the use of technology to help collect and summarise data in real-time for clinical use. The purpose of this review is to appraise the current evidence-base for the use of technology-assisted screening of functional PROs in the HNC population and to identify areas of future research need.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\tMethods: Online databases were searched for relevant papers published up to October 2013. In total, 44 papers were identified and appraised for suitability for inclusion in this review. Following critical review, seven publications were included in the final analysis.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\tResults: Findings from the reviewed publications demonstrated that technology-assisted screening of patient-reported functional status is feasible and has the potential to accurately capture the functional concerns of patients along the cancer trajectory of care.&nbsp; However, at present the majority of studies exhibit methodological limitations which currently restrict the application of the findings to the broader clinical context.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\tConclusions: Technology-assisted screening of functional status in the HNC population may be a solution to assist routine collection of PROs and optimise supportive care intervention, though further systematic research is needed. These applications have the potential to be used across cancer diagnoses, with both patients and carers, and throughout the continuum of care.",

This gives to mitotic cells a selective advantage since they deplete other cell reserves for their benefit. The pancreatic GABA selection switch between anabolism and catabolism explains the process, a deficient release of GABA from beta cells, leads to a concomitant release of catabolic glucagon and anabolic insulin, and to a progressive desensitization of insulin receptors on differentiated cells.

Salman  Ashraf , Somaira  Nowsheen , Xujuan  Yang<br>\n<br>\n One of the hallmarks of malignant cell populations is the ability to undergo continuous proliferation. This property allows clonal lineages to acquire sequential aberrations that can fuel increasingly autonomous growth, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. Innate cellular mechanisms have evolved to regulate replicative potential as a hedge against malignant progression. When activated in the absence of normal terminal differentiation cues, these mechanisms can result in a state of persistent cytostasis. This state, termed \u201csenescence,\u201d can be triggered by intrinsic cellular processes such as telomere dysfunction and oncogene expression, and by exogenous factors such as DNA damaging agents or oxidative environments. Despite differences in upstream signaling, senescence often involves convergent interdependent activation of tumor suppressors p53 and p16/pRB, but can be induced, albeit with reduced sensitivity, when these suppressors are compromised. Doses of conventional genotoxic drugs required to achieve cancer cell senescence are often much lower than doses required to achieve outright cell death. Additional therapies, such as those targeting cyclin dependent kinases or components of the PI3K signaling pathway, may induce senescence specifically in cancer cells by circumventing defects in tumor suppressor pathways or exploiting cancer cells\u2019 heightened requirements for telomerase. Such treatments sufficient to induce cancer cell senescence could provide increased patient survival with fewer and less severe side effects than conventional cytotoxic regimens. This positive aspect is countered by important caveats regarding senescence reversibility, genomic instability, and paracrine effects that may increase heterogeneity and adaptive resistance of surviving cancer cells. Nevertheless, agents that effectively disrupt replicative immortality will likely be valuable components of new combinatorial approaches to cancer therapy. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Garcia<br>\n<br>\n Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) originate from embryonic mesoderm and give rise to the multiple lineages of connective tissues. Transformed MSCs develop into aggressive sarcomas, some of which are initiated by specific chromosomal translocations that generate fusion proteins with potent oncogenic properties. The sarcoma oncogenes typically prime MSCs through aberrant reprogramming. They dictate commitment to a specific lineage but prevent mature differentiation, thus locking the cells in a state of proliferative precursors. Deregulated expression of lineage-specific transcription factors and controllers of chromatin structure play a central role in MSC reprogramming and sarcoma pathogenesis. This suggests that reversing the epigenetic aberrancies created by the sarcoma oncogenes with differentiation-related reagents holds great promise as a beneficial addition to sarcoma therapies. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

However, emerging evidence suggests a surprising capacity for normal committed cells to function as reserve stem cells upon reprogramming as a consequence of tissue damage resulting in inflammation and wound healing. This results in an alternative concept positing that tumors may originate from differentiated cells that can re-acquire stem cell properties due to genetic or epigenetic reprogramming. It is likely that both models are correct, and that a continuum of potential cells of origin exists, ranging from early primitive stem cells to committed progenitor or even terminally differentiated cells. A combination of the nature of the target cell and the specific types of gene mutations introduced determine tumor cell lineage, as well as potential for malignant conversion. Evidence from mouse skin models of carcinogenesis suggests that initiated cells at different stages within a stem cell hierarchy have varying degrees of requirement for reprogramming (e.g. inflammation stimuli), depending on their degree of differentiation. This article will present evidence in favor of these concepts that has been developed from studies of several mouse models of skin carcinogenesis. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The diverse tissues involved and the highly variable clinicopathologic features are related to an interaction between the neoplastic lymphoid cells and the tissues that they infiltrate. When different subpopulations of T-cells undergo transformation, they retain some of their inherent characteristics, including tissue tropisms, gene expression profiles and cytokine secretion patterns; which collaborate to impact on the cellular composition and structure of the lymphoma. Non-neoplastic cellular components of the lymphoma, including normal T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils are altered by the neoplastic lymphoid cells, leading to changes in patterns of gene and protein expressions. These changes in turn modify the microenvironment of the lymphoma, inducing blood vessel formation and providing survival and proliferative signals to the neoplastic lymphoid cells. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages undergo M2 polarization as a result of the cytokines produced by the neoplastic T-cells. These macrophages in turn promote angiogenesis and inhibit anti-tumor cellular immunity. The macrophage content has been shown to correlate with treatment outcome in clinical studies. The effects of normal lymphocytes on T-cell lymphoma biology are more conflicting, with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the neoplastic cells demonstrated in vitro. Endothelial cells from micro-vessels interact with neoplastic T-cells mainly through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of microvasculature have also been demonstrated in some clinical trials. This complex network of cellular, immunological and molecular interactions underlies the pathologies, clinical manifestations and treatment outcome of T-cell lymphomas. The understanding of the impact of the microenvironment on neoplastic T-cells should be further exploited in translational research to generate biomarkers that may be applicable to disease classification, treatment and prognostication. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Initially, single viral infection was considered fully responsible for the oncogenic properties of each virus, while it is now established that in many cases, multiple viral agents collaborate as cofactors in inducing lymphomas, especially in the presence of HIV-dependent immunodeficiency. Viruses cooperate by using their specific pathogenetic mechanisms in different combinations. The aim of this review is to describe the cooperation between different viruses in the development of lymphomas including the evidences supporting their pathogenetic role. Viral cooperation, a mechanism by which different viruses coinfecting human tissues have synergistic or regulatory effects on carcinogenesis, targets neoplastic B cells as well as cells of the microenvironment, such as reactive T-cells, B cells and macrophages, as well as non-immune cells such as endothelial cells, that contribute to tumor microenvironment. The most important viral genes involved in cooperation include HIV-1 tat and vpu, EBV LMP-1 and EBNA-2 and KSHV KIE2, Rta and LANA. Lymphomagenesis related to viral cooperation represents an interesting topic where microenvironmental abnormalities may be particularly relevant, particularly because antiviral targeted therapies and therapies producing the reconstitution of the immune system may constitute areas of interest aiming at improving the outcome of virus associated lymphomas. While the immune component of the lymphoma microenvironment can be easily studied by immunological and molecular techniques, the definition of the non-immune component of the lymphoma microenvironment is largely incomplete and may be the issue of future investigations. Understanding the pathogenetic role of viral infection in specific malignancies and defining microenvironmental abnormalities and mechanisms of viral carcinogenesis are important steps toward precise diagnosis and accurate treatment strategies for HIV-associated cancers. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Maxwell<br>\n<br>\n Genomic instability can initiate cancer, augment progression, and influence the overall prognosis of the affected patient. Genomic instability arises from many different pathways, such as telomere damage, centrosome amplification, epigenetic modifications, and DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous sources, and can be perpetuating, or limiting, through the induction of mutations or aneuploidy, both enabling and catastrophic. Many cancer treatments induce DNA damage to impair cell division on a global scale but it is accepted that personalized treatments, those that are tailored to the particular patient and type of cancer, must also be developed. In this review, we detail the mechanisms from which genomic instability arises and can lead to cancer, as well as treatments and measures that prevent genomic instability or take advantage of the cellular defects caused by genomic instability. In particular, we identify and discuss five priority targets against genomic instability: (1) prevention of DNA damage; (2) enhancement of DNA repair; (3) targeting deficient DNA repair; (4) impairing centrosome clustering; and, (5) inhibition of telomerase activity. Moreover, we highlight vitamin D and B, selenium, carotenoids, PARP inhibitors, resveratrol, and isothiocyanates as priority approaches against genomic instability. The prioritized target sites and approaches were cross validated to identify potential synergistic effects on a number of important areas of cancer biology. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In order to continue to proliferate, cancer cells must somehow uncouple themselves from the many signals that exist to slow down cell growth. Here, we define the anti-growth signaling process, and review several important pathways involved in growth signaling: p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Hippo, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), Notch, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) pathways. Aberrations in these processes in cancer cells involve mutations and thus the suppression of genes that prevent growth, as well as mutation and activation of genes involved in driving cell growth. Using these pathways as examples, we prioritize molecular targets that might be leveraged to promote anti-growth signaling in cancer cells. Interestingly, naturally-occurring phytochemicals found in human diets (either singly or as mixtures) may promote anti-growth signaling, and do so without the potentially adverse effects associated with synthetic chemicals. We review examples of naturally-occurring phytochemicals that may be applied to prevent cancer by antagonizing growth signaling, and propose one phytochemical for each pathway. These are: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for the Rb pathway, luteolin for p53, curcumin for PTEN, porphyrins for Hippo, genistein for GDF15, resveratrol for ARID1A, withaferin A for Notch and diguelin for the IGF1-receptor pathway. The coordination of anti-growth signaling and natural compound studies will provide insight into the future application of these compounds in the clinical setting. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Such a functionally peculiar variant of apoptosis has been dubbed immunogenic cell death (ICD). One of the central events in the course of ICD is the activation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This is instrumental for cells undergoing ICD to emit all the signals that are required for their demise to be perceived as immunogenic by the host, and culminates with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). In particular, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is required for the pre-apoptotic exposure of the ER chaperone calreticulin (CALR) on the cell surface, which is a central determinant of ICD. Importantly, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 can be quantified in both preclinical and clinical samples by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry using phosphoneoepitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. Of note, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and CALR exposure do not necessarily correlate with each other, and neither of these parameters is sufficient for cell death to be perceived as immunogenic. Nonetheless, accumulating data indicate that assessing the degree of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 provides a convenient parameter to monitor ICD. Here, we discuss the role of the ER stress response in ICD and the potential value of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as a biomarker for this clinically relevant variant of apoptosis. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and plays a pivotal role in tumor development. Depending on ER stress intensity and duration, the UPR is either pro-survival to preserve ER homeostasis or pro-death if the stress cannot be resolved. On one hand, the adaptive arm of the UPR is essential for cancer cells to survive the harsh conditions they are facing, and on the other hand, cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to bypass ER stress-induced cell death, thereby conferring them with a selective advantage for malignant transformation. Therefore, the mechanisms involved in the balance between survival and death outcomes of the UPR may be exploited as therapeutic tools to treat cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

The lymphoma microenvironment is characterized by a heterogeneous population of stromal cells, including fibroblastic reticular cells, nurse-like cells, mesenchymal stem cells, follicular dendritic cells, and inflammatory cells such as macrophages, T- and B-cells. These cell populations interact with the lymphoma cells to promote lymphoma growth, survival and drug resistance through multiple mechanisms. Angiogenesis is also recognized as an important factor associated with lymphoma progression. In recent years, we have learned that the interaction between the malignant and non-malignant cells is bidirectional and resembles, at least in part, the pattern seen between non-neoplastic lymphoid cells and the normal microenvironment of lymphoid organs. A summary of the current knowledge of lymphoma microenvironment focusing on the cellular components will be reviewed here. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Kwon<br>\n<br>\n Cancer immune evasion is a major stumbling block in designing effective anticancer therapeutic strategies. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding how cancers evade destructive immunity, measures to counteract tumor escape have not kept pace. There are a number of factors that contribute to tumor persistence despite having a normal host immune system. Immune editing is one of the key aspects why tumors evade surveillance causing the tumors to lie dormant in patients for years through \u201cequilibrium\u201d and \u201csenescence\u201d before re-emerging. In addition, tumors exploit several immunological processes such as targeting the regulatory T cell function or their secretions, antigen presentation, modifying the production of immune suppressive mediators, tolerance and immune deviation. Besides these, tumor heterogeneity and metastasis also play a critical role in tumor growth. A number of potential targets like promoting Th1, NK cell, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses, inhibiting Treg functionality, induction of IL-12, use of drugs including phytochemicals have been designed to counter tumor progression with much success. Some natural agents and phytochemicals merit further study. For example, use of certain key polysaccharide components from mushrooms and plants have shown to possess therapeutic impact on tumor-imposed genetic instability, anti-growth signaling, replicative immortality, deregulated metabolism etc. In this review, we will discuss the advances made toward understanding the basis of cancer immune evasion and summarize the efficacy of various therapeutic measures and targets that have been developed or are being investigated to enhance tumor rejection. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

DNA sequencing analyses of lymphoma have identified several aberrations that might affect the interaction between malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment. Microenvironmental functions are essential to lymphoma; they provide survival and proliferation signals and license immune evasion. It is plausible that interventions that aim to destroy tumor\u2013microenvironment interactions may improve responses to therapeutics. Accordingly, the identification of extrinsic factors and their downstream intracellular signaling targets has led to much progress in understanding tumor\u2013microenvironment interactions. Lymphoma cells are differently influenced by cells\u2019 interactions with components of their microenvironment; these cell extrinsic factors include soluble and immobilized factors, the extracellular matrix, and signals presented by neighboring cells. Soluble factors, which are often cell-secreted autocrine and paracrine factors, comprise a significant fraction of targetable molecules. To begin to understand how intercellular communication is conducted in lymphoma, a first order of study is deciphering the soluble factors secreted by malignant cells and microenvironmental cells. These soluble factors are shed into the interstitial fluid in lymphoma and can be conveniently explored using mass spectrometry. Protein components can be detected and quantified, thus enabling the routine navigation of the soluble part of the microenvironment. Elucidating functional and signaling states affords a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology and devising new therapies.

Several cancer treatments stimulate the autophagic process and when autophagy is inhibited, cancer cells show an enhanced response to multiple treatments. These findings have nourished the theory that autophagy provides cancer cells with a survival advantage during stressful conditions, including exposure to therapeutics. Therefore, interference with the autophagic response can potentially enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy. In this review we examine two approaches to modulate autophagy as complementary cancer treatment: inhibition and induction. Inhibition of autophagy during cancer treatment eliminates its cytoprotective effects. Conversely, induction of autophagy combined with conventional cancer therapy exerts severe cytoplasmic degradation that can ultimately lead to cell death. We will discuss how autophagy can be therapeutically manipulated in cancer cells and how interactions between the conventional cancer therapies and autophagy modulation influence treatment outcome. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

It has recently been confirmed as a significant promoter of malignant progression. Its role in signal transduction was first implied through the interaction with integrin receptors, either by binding with the RGD motif or by proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal amino acids of the cytosolic part of the integrin beta chain. Several other molecules, involved in cellular signaling, have since been shown to be targets for cathepsin X, such as \u03b3-enolase, chemokine CXCL-12, bradykinin, kallidin, huntingtin and profilin 1. In cancer, cathepsin X regulates adhesion of tumor and endothelial cells and their migration and invasion through the extracellular matrix. It also promotes tumor progression by bypassing cellular senescence and by inducing an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. The high RNA and protein levels of cathepsin X, found in tumor samples and bodily fluids of patients with various cancer types, further support its active role in tumor progression. Its prognostic value and relation to response to chemotherapy confirm cathepsin X as a new target for improving diagnosis and treating cancer patients. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Hypoxia is a key component generating intratumoral oxygen gradients, which affect the cellular expression program and lead to therapy resistance and increased metastatic propensity of weakly oxygenated cell subpopulations. One of the adaptive responses of tumor cells to hypoxia involves the increased expression and functional activation of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a cancer-related cell surface enzyme catalyzing the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ion and proton. Via its catalytic activity, CA IX participates in regulation of intracellular and extracellular pH perturbations that result from hypoxia-induced changes in cellular metabolism producing excess of acid. Through the ability to regulate pH, CA IX also facilitates cell migration and invasion. In addition, CA IX has non-catalytic function in cell adhesion and spreading. Thus, CA IX endows tumor cells with survival advantages in hypoxia/acidosis and confers an increased ability to migrate, invade and metastasize. Accordingly, CA IX is expressed in a broad range of tumors, where it is associated with prognosis and therapy outcome. Its expression pattern and functional implications in tumor biology make CA IX a promising therapeutic target, which can be hit either by immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies or with compounds inhibiting its enzyme activity. The first strategy has already reached the clinical trials, whereas the second one is still in preclinical testing. Both strategies indicate that CA IX can become a clinically useful anticancer target, but urge further efforts toward better selection of patients for immunotherapy and deeper understanding of tumor types, clinical situations and synthetic lethality interactions with other treatment approaches. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Consequently, intrinsic and acquired therapy resistance arises and presents one of the major goals to solve in oncologic research today. Among the myriad of microenvironmental factors impacting on cancer cell resistance, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) has recently been identified as key determinant. Despite the differentiation between cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAMDR) and cell adhesion-mediated radioresistance (CAMRR), the underlying mechanisms share great overlap in integrin and focal adhesion hub signaling and differ further downstream in the complexity of signaling networks between tumor entities. Intriguingly, cell adhesion to ECM is per se also essential for cancer cells similar to their normal counterparts. However, based on the overexpression of focal adhesion hub signaling receptors and proteins and a distinct addiction to particular integrin receptors, targeting of focal adhesion proteins has been shown to potently sensitize cancer cells to different treatment regimes including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and novel molecular therapeutics.

BCICs have been identified in clinical specimens based on CD44+/CD24\u2212/low membrane expression and/or enzymatic activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1+), or isolated and in vitro propagated as non-adherent spheres. This cell population has been demonstrated to be able to recreate, when injected in mice even at very low concentrations, the same histopathological features of the tumor they were derived from and to escape from current therapeutic strategies. Alterations in genes involved in stemness-related pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog, have been proven to play a role in breast cancer progression. Targeting these key elements represents an attractive option, with a solid rationale, although possible concerns may derive from the poor knowledge of tolerance and efficacy of inhibiting these mechanisms without inducing severe side effects. In addition, efforts to develop alternative BCIC-targeted therapies against stemness markers (CD44 and ALDH1) and molecules involved in regulating EMT- and HER2-related pathways, or able to reverse the multi-drug resistance phenotype, or to induce differentiation and to control cell survival pathways are currently ongoing and encouraging results from pre-clinical studies have already been obtained using in vitro and in vivo models. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

A host of studies have demonstrated that although CSCs and their non-tumorigenic progenies within the same clone can share common genotype, they display different epigenetic profiles that results in changes of multiple signaling pathways. Many of these pathways confer cell adaptation to the microenvironmental stresses including inflammation, hypoxia, low pH, shortage in nutrients and anti-cancer therapies. Treatment strategies based on combination of conventional therapies targeting bulk tumor cells and CSC-specific pathway inhibition bear a promise to improve cancer cure compared to monotherapies.

It postulates that solid cancers are organized hierarchically with a small number of cancer stem cells driving tumor growth, repopulation after injury and metastasis. They give rise to differentiated progeny, which lack these features. The model predicts that for any therapy to provide cure, all cancer stem cells have to be eliminated while the survival of differentiated progeny is less critical. In this review we discuss recent reports challenging the idea of a unidirectional differentiation of cancer cells. These reports provide evidence supporting the idea that non-stem cancer cells exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity that allows them to re-acquire cancer stem cell traits, especially in the context of radiation therapy. We summarize conditions under which differentiation is reversed and discuss the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Tumor and host cells co-evolve dynamically through indirect and direct cellular interactions, eliciting multiscale effects on many biological programs, including cellular proliferation, growth, and metabolism, as well as angiogenesis and hypoxia and innate and adaptive immunity. Here we highlight specific biological processes that could be exploited as targets for the prevention and therapy of cancer. Specifically, we describe how inhibition of targets such as cholesterol synthesis and metabolites, reactive oxygen species and hypoxia, macrophage activation and conversion, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase regulation of dendritic cells, vascular endothelial growth factor regulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis inhibition, endoglin, and Janus kinase signaling emerge as examples of important potential nexuses in the regulation of tumorigenesis and the tumor microenvironment that can be targeted. We have also identified therapeutic agents as approaches, in particular natural products such as berberine, resveratrol, onionin A, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, curcumin, naringenin, desoxyrhapontigenin, piperine, and zerumbone, that may warrant further investigation to target the tumor microenvironment for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Agostinis<br>\n<br>\n Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are emerging as key adaptation mechanisms in response to loss of proteostasis, with major cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions impacting cancer progression and therapeutic responses. In recent years, vital physiological roles of the ER in maintenance of proteostasis, Ca2+ signaling and trafficking through the secretory pathway have emerged. Some of these functions have been shown to be decisive for mobilizing certain signals from injured/dying cancer cells in response to certain anticancer treatments, toward the plasma membrane and ultimately emit them into the extracellular environment, where they may act as danger signals. The spatiotemporally defined emission of these signals, better known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), distinguishes this type of cancer cell death from physiological apoptosis, which is tolerogenic in nature, thereby enabling these dying cancer cells to alert the immune system and \u201cre-activate\u201d antitumor immunity. The emission of DAMPs, decisive for immunogenic cell death (ICD) and which include the ER chaperone calreticulin and ATP, is reliant on a danger signaling module induced by certain assorted anticancer treatments through oxidative-ER stress. The main focus of this review is to discuss the emerging role of ER-stress regulated pathways and processes in danger signaling thereby regulating the cancer cell-immune cell interface by the extracellular emission of DAMPs. In particular, we discuss signaling contexts existing upstream and around PERK, a major ER-stress sensor in ICD context, which have not been emphatically discussed in the context of antitumor immunity and ICD up until now. Finally, we briefly discuss the pros and cons of targeting PERK in the context of ICD. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Patient prognosis is tightly linked with metastatic dissemination of the disease to distant sites, with metastatic diseases accounting for a vast percentage of cancer patient mortality.

The current article summarizes recent progress in this area of research, both in the understanding of the underlying biological processes and in the therapeutic strategies for the management of metastasis. This review lists the disruption of E-cadherin and tight junctions, key signaling pathways, including urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (PI3K/AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), \u03b2-catenin/zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), together with inactivation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity as key targets and the use of phytochemicals, or natural products, such as those from Agaricus blazei, Albatrellus confluens, Cordyceps militaris, Ganoderma lucidum, Poria cocos and Silybum marianum, together with diet derived fatty acids gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and inhibitory compounds as useful approaches to target tissue invasion and metastasis as well as other hallmark areas of cancer.

Adaptation to stress and re-establishment of ER homeostasis is achieved by activation of an integrated signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Both ER stress and UPR activation have been implicated in a variety of human cancers. Although at early stages or physiological conditions of ER stress, the UPR generally promotes survival, when the stress becomes more stringent or prolonged, its role can switch to a pro-cell death one. Here, we discuss historical and recent evidence supporting an involvement of the UPR in malignancy, describe the main mechanisms by which tumor cells overcome ER stress to promote their survival, tumor progression and metastasis and discuss the current state of efforts to develop therapeutic approaches of targeting the UPR. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

This is manifest by altered expression and/or activity of cell cycle related proteins. Constitutive activation of many signal transduction pathways also stimulates cell growth. Early steps in tumor development are associated with a fibrogenic response and the development of a hypoxic environment which favors the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells. Part of the survival strategy of cancer stem cells may manifested by alterations in cell metabolism. Once tumors appear, growth and metastasis may be supported by overproduction of appropriate hormones (in hormonally dependent cancers), by promoting angiogenesis, by undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, by triggering autophagy, and by taking cues from surrounding stromal cells. A number of natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, indole-3-carbinol, brassinin, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, ellagitannins, lycopene and quercetin) have been found to inhibit one or more pathways that contribute to proliferation (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor 1, nuclear factor kappa B, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, Wnt, cell cycle associated proteins, as well as androgen and estrogen receptor signaling). These data, in combination with bioinformatics analyses, will be very important for identifying signaling pathways and molecular targets that may provide early diagnostic markers and/or critical targets for the development of new drugs or drug combinations that block tumor formation and progression. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

In solid tumors, the UPR mediates adaptation to various environmental stressors, including hypoxia, low in pH and low nutrients availability, driving positive selection.

Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However, in cancer, de-regulated apoptotic signaling, particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems, allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival, therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented. This review provides a roadmap for the design of successful anti-cancer strategies that overcome resistance to apoptosis for better therapeutic outcome in patients with cancer. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Indeed, EBV up-regulates the production of several soluble factors promoting the growth and/or the survival of lymphoid cells and orchestrates a variety of complex mechanisms favoring their escape from anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, EBV-infected B lymphocytes actively secrete exosomes and recent investigation is now shedding light on the content and functional impact that these bioactive vesicles may have in bystander recipient cells.

Hupp<br>\n<br>\n Proteins targeted to secretory pathway enter the endoplasmic reticulum where they undergo post-translational modification and subsequent quality control executed by exquisite catalysts of protein folding, protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). These enzymes can often provide strict conformational protein folding solutions to highly cysteine-rich cargo as they facilitate disulphide rearrangement in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under conditions when PDI substrates are not isomerised properly, secreted proteins can accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress initiation with implications for human disease development. Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident PDI superfamily member that has emerged as a dominant effector of basic biological properties in vertebrates including blastoderm formation and limb regeneration. AGR2 perturbation in mammals influences disease processes including cancer progression and drug resistance, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. This review will focus on the molecular characteristics, function, and regulation of AGR2, views on its emerging biological functions and misappropriation in disease, and prospects for therapeutic intervention into endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein folding pathways for improving the treatment of human disease. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

While efforts have been made to combine targeted therapies, significant levels of toxicity have stymied efforts to effectively treat cancer with multi-drug combinations using currently approved therapeutics. We discuss the relationship between tumor-promoting inflammation and cancer as part of a larger effort to develop a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach aimed at a wide range of targets to address this heterogeneity. Specifically, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, cyclooxygenase-2, transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB, tumor necrosis factor alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase B, and CXC chemokines are reviewed as important antiinflammatory targets while curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, lycopene, and anthocyanins are reviewed as low-cost, low toxicity means by which these targets might all be reached simultaneously. Future translational work will need to assess the resulting synergies of rationally designed antiinflammatory mixtures (employing low-toxicity constituents), and then combine this with similar approaches targeting the most important pathways across the range of cancer hallmark phenotypes. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

Koong<br>\n<br>\n Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to ER stress, which is characteristic of cells with high level of secretory activity and implicated in a variety of disease conditions. In response to ER stress, the cell elicits an adaptive process called the unfolded protein response (UPR) to support cellular homeostasis and survival. However, prolonged and unsolvable ER stress also induces apoptosis. As the most conserved signaling branch of the UPR, the IRE1\u03b1\u2013XBP1 pathway plays important roles in both physiological and pathological settings and its activity has profound effects on disease progression and prognosis. Recently, modulating this pathway with small molecule compounds has been demonstrated as a promising approach for disease therapy. In this review, we summarize a list of current investigational compounds targeting this pathway and their therapeutic features for treating human diseases. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

                "abstract": "Publication date: Available online 9 May 2015<br>\n Source:Seminars in Cancer Biology<br>\n     Author(s): Lesley-Ann  Sutton , Richard  Rosenquist<br>\n<br>\n With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the mutational landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was rapidly unraveled with the discovery of recurrently mutated genes affecting key signaling pathways. Although the majority of these mutations are relatively infrequent at diagnosis (at least at the population-level) they tend to accumulate as the disease progresses or at relapse. Besides TP53 aberrations, several of these newly mutated genes have consistently been linked to shorter time to progression/treatment and poor overall survival (e.g. NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3). These findings coupled with the diverse (sub)clonal evolution trajectory followed by CLL cells, at least in treated patients, alludes to their role as major subclonal driver events for disease progression. Together with the dependence of CLL cells on B-cell receptor (BcR) signaling and antigen stimulation, this reveals a disease within which both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors conspire to fuel leukemogenesis, and we have only recently begun to understand their intricate interplay. This was further highlighted with the efficiency of new targeted therapy interfering with the microenvironment and in particular with BcR signaling. Further investigations will now be paramount in order to individualize treatment, to define optimal combination therapies and to integrate molecular characterization for response prediction, in this, as yet, incurable disease. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",

While the pathogenesis of these lymphomas is incompletely understood, evidence indicates that immune deregulation, genetic alterations and cytokine production play an important role in HIV lymphomagenesis. The lymphoma microenvironment in this heterogeneous group of lymphomas plays an equally critical role in their development, growth and progression. Important components of the microenvironment in HIV-related lymphomas include EBV and/or HHV-8 coinfection, reactive inflammatory cells, tumor microvasculature, and soluble factors. This paper provides a brief overview of HIV-related lymphomas and focuses on their lymphomagenesis and microenvironment. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n",
