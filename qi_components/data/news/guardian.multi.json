The Tender SURE (Specifications for Urban Road Extension) roads have extra-wide pavements on both sides of the road, unheard of in Indian cities. In some cases, the combined width of the pavements is wider than the road itself. This is intentional: unlike the old pavements, which often featured external \u2013 and lethal \u2013 electric wires, sewerage and water pipes, the new roads accommodate all utilities under the pavements. Tender SURE roads also have carefully allocated spaces for parking cars and bikes and many will have cycle lanes. Currently, only two roads in the city\u2019s central business district have been completed, but a total of 50 have been earmarked for Tender SURE, at a cost of 2bn rupees (&pound;20.25m).

The cab pulls up at the Los Angeles Convention Centre, where the event takes place over three days. The building is draped in advertising for next year\u2019s blockbuster titles. Murray exits the car with a slam and begins to weave through the crowd, clustered around screens and fingerprint-smeared controllers. He arrives at one of Sony\u2019s cool private meeting rooms, just as Spielberg and his entourage arrive. Inside, Murray, with an apologetic press of a button, loads up the universe.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/12/no-mans-sky-18-quintillion-planets-hello-games\">Continue reading...</a>",

Sony proudly showed off its console \u2013 now called the Play Station \u2013 at the 1991 Consumer Electronics Show, but Nintendo switched its allegiance to Philips a day later. Enraged, Sony decided to release a new PlayStation console on its own, and many of the SNES-CD prototype units were destroyed.

Tiger Woods has been the cover star since 1998, but considering his wane in fortunes, it is understandable that he has been bundled into a golf cart and sent on his way. Now Rory McIlroy, who looks just as fiercely motivated and skilled as the young Tiger once did, will front a fresh chapter for the series. </p><p>At first, long-time fans will most likely find the absence of Woods jarring, at first. It feels strange to begin the \u201cPrologue\u201d section of the game and find McIlroy staring back at you recanting his own experiences, rather than reliving some of Tiger\u2019s many achievements. But the nostalgia fades as McIlroy, directly addressing the player, talks about how it feels to stand on the opening tee in the final round of a major championship. It is unusually candid, offering a lot more insight than most golfers ever would in a TV interview.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/rory-mcilroy-golf-review-simulation-ea-sports\">Continue reading...</a>",

House Of Wolves, the game\u2019s second major add-on, won\u2019t assuage any doubts you might be harbouring about the plot: you\u2019re asked by the Queen to destroy the rival House Of Wolves, and you do it. But the action is as gripping as ever, adding tricky new missions and extending the level cap. It also gives you a new hub area in the Asteroid Belt, from which you can do all the equipment-buying, bounty-refreshing and engram-decoding you used to do back on Earth, with a more spectacular purple-hued backdrop. There are also fresh maps for the Crucible, Destiny\u2019s competitive multiplayer area, and a new strike mission, Shadow Thief. It\u2019s not cheap, but if you\u2019re still playing Destiny, chances are you\u2019d pay almost anything for something new to do.</p><p><strong>ALSO OUT THIS WEEK</strong></p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/destiny-house-of-wolves-review\">Continue reading...</a>",

Only in London at the moment, the interface is slick \u2013 finding your location automatically and scanning your credit card number with the iPhone\u2019s camera, making it a breeze to order. Put in what it is you need to be cleaned, then choose a half-hour collection and delivery slot. The cost compares well with a service wash at a local launderette \u2013 &pound;12.50 for a bag of washing and &pound;10 for a two-piece suit \u2013 and it works fantastically, but while it is sure to be a big hit in New York, where communal facilities are the norm, it seems unlikely it will ever be more than a niche product in the UK. Equally, <strong>Zomato</strong> (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, free) is the latest restaurant finder, but what makes it stands out is the breadth of its service. Select to search for coffee-shops, a plethora of culinary genres, or even somewhere specialising in hot chocolate, and the app locates them on a map. From there you can browse the menu and book a table. Good for the tastebuds, if not so beneficial to the waistband.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/19/zipjet-zomato-review-dry-cleaning-and-restaurant-booking-apps\">Continue reading...</a>",
