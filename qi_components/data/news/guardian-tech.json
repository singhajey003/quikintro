Equally, <strong>Zomato</strong> (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, free) is the latest restaurant finder, but what makes it stands out is the breadth of its service. Select to search for coffee-shops, a plethora of culinary genres, or even somewhere specialising in hot chocolate, and the app locates them on a map.
