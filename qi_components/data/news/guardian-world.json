Praise of that sort might sound patronising, until you get the chance to read the second volume of her autobiography to be published in a fortnight. The first book told of her entry into a strict order of Roman Catholic nuns. Her new book, Beginning the World, describes how, still a member of her strict order of nuns, she was sent to an Oxford college in 1969 to study English. She eventually left the order while she was a student.
