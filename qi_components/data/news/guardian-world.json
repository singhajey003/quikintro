A controversial, and expensive, new project aims to make Bangalore more walkable instead</p><p>In traffic choked Bangalore, the motorist is king. In this city of 11 million people and <a href=\"http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/civic/Over-50L-vehicles-and-nowhere-to-go/articleshow/45015765.cms\">5m cars</a>, pedestrians are shoved on to narrow, potholed, often non-existent pavements with <a href=\"http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/cover-story/Pedestrian-is-the-most-endangered-species-in-the-city/articleshow/30356387.cms\">deadly results</a>. So far, all attempts at easing congestion have been aimed at widening roads by cutting down trees.</p><p>Now, a controversial new project is revamping Bangalore\u2019s roads, aiming to make it a more walkable city. The Tender SURE (Specifications for Urban Road Extension) roads have extra-wide pavements on both sides of the road, unheard of in Indian cities. In some cases, the combined width of the pavements is wider than the road itself. This is intentional: unlike the old pavements, which often featured external \u2013 and lethal \u2013 electric wires, sewerage and water pipes, the new roads accommodate all utilities under the pavements. Tender SURE roads also have carefully allocated spaces for parking cars and bikes and many will have cycle lanes. Currently, only two roads in the city\u2019s central business district have been completed, but a total of 50 have been earmarked for Tender SURE, at a cost of 2bn rupees (&pound;20.25m). There are also plans to take the roads to Chennai and Hyderabad.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/15/bangalore-new-pavement-road-design-walkable-traffic-pedestrian\">Continue reading...</a>",
