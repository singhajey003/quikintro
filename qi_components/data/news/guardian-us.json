Now, a new retrospective shows how he became a modern master \u2013 and how the masses finally caught up with him </p><p>\u201cTo see something spectacular and recognise it as a photographic possibility is not making a very big leap,\u201d Stephen Shore once said. \u201cBut to see something ordinary, something you\u2019d see every day, and recognise it as a photographic possibility \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d </p><p> Shore\u2019s vision of the ordinary world is now so pervasive an influence on photography that it almost goes uncommented on. But back when he first unveiled it in New York in 1972, with a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, his colour images of everyday America caused consternation and derision. \u201cThe press coverage, what little there was of it, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/nov/13/photography.shopping\">uniformly terrible</a>,\u201d he once told me. \u201cPeople just did not exhibit colour images then. I remember the great Paul Strand taking me aside and advising me in no uncertain terms that it would be a disastrous career move. I am often asked what it was that people objected to exactly in the show and the answer is: all of it. Everything.\u2019\u2019 </p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/09/stephen-shore-america-colour-photography-1970s\">Continue reading...</a>",
