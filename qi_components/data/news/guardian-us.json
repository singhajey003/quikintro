So it is tempting to treat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/10/northern-ireland-government-on-brink-of-collapse\" title=\"\">the latest breakdown</a> as, in the end, merely another of these almost ritualised temporary impasses. Sooner or later, it may seem safe to predict, the rival parties will extricate themselves from the current confrontation. If that happens, the withdrawal of the first minister Peter Robinson and most of his Democratic Unionist ministers on Thursday will be seen as a frustrating but ultimately not a lethal threat to Northern Irish politics.</p><p>Events may well prove this judgment right. Yet the issue that has provoked this stand-off is not trivial. Members of the Provisional IRA <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/22/psni-provisional-ira-northern-ireland-kevin-mcguigan-republican\" title=\"\">may have been involved</a> in a Belfast revenge killing last month. However, the IRA supposedly ceased to operate in 2005. So if some sort of vestigial IRA is still in existence and at work, the trustworthiness of Sinn F&eacute;in assurances is inevitably called into question, not only among their traditional political foes. An incident like this plays seamlessly into the suspicions that underlie much of Northern Ireland politics, with consequences like the DUP withdrawals this week. That is unfortunate, but it is not entirely inexplicable either. At the very least, the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to the facts.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-crisis-in-northern-ireland-playing-a-dangerous-game\">Continue reading...</a>",

He tries to best the record of Bert \u201cCampy\u201d Campaneris, who played all nine positions on the field in 1965 in a game for the Kansas City Athletics.

Much has been made of his poor performance in a pre-season friendly against Paris St-Germain when Louis van Gaal said his No1 goalkeeper wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to play. He\u2019s continued to overlook him. But now, with the move to Real Madrid <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/01/david-de-gea-manchester-united-real-madrid-knuckle-down\">having collapsed</a> and a new deal confirmed, the United manager would have to be spectacularly pig-headed not to select the Spain goalkeeper, who finally got some first-team action when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/09/spain-euro-2016-goalkeeper-own-goal-macedonia\">kept a clean sheet in midweek</a> against Macedonia. It was against Liverpool at Old Trafford last season that De Gea made a string of stunning saves early in the game that frustrated Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side to the extent that they ran out of momentum after a positive start. United grew in confidence and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/14/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">went on to win 3-0</a>. It was a theme throughout the season. Even when Manchester United were coughing and spluttering their way through games with disjointed football and head-scratching formations, they could often rely on creating very few chances to win a game because they had such comprehensive insurance in goal. With so many question marks still hanging over United\u2019s team selection and formation, Van Gaal can cure one headache right away by restoring his best goalkeeper to the starting lineup for what remains of the Spaniard\u2019s career at Old Trafford. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">GB</strong></p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/11/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend-matches\">Continue reading...</a>",

Could one of the world\u2019s most deadly scorpions come to their aid?<p>In 2004, Dr Richard Ellenbogen prepared to operate on a 17-year-old girl. The operation, to remove a brain tumour, was particularly challenging because it was in the frontal lobe, close to important areas for movement, speech and learning. It lasted nearly 20 hours. Dr Ellenbogen ended up leaving a big piece of the tumour behind, mistaking it for normal brain tissue. Less than a year after the surgery, the cancer came back, and the girl died.</p><p>A few days after his young patient\u2019s death, Ellenbogen presented the case at his team\u2019s weekly meeting at Seattle children\u2019s hospital. The failure had left him deeply frustrated. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a way to take more of the tumour out and leave more of the normal brain intact,\u201d he said. The nagging feeling that he could have removed more of the cancerous tumour would not leave him alone. Scalpel in hand, Ellenbogen had faced a dilemma: if he had removed more tumour, he might also have removed normal brain tissue, with the risk that the girl would have been left severely disabled. Neurosurgeons have to be aggressive and sometimes push themselves to go further and deeper than they would like, but they all operate under the principle \u201cdo no harm\u201d.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/10/how-to-light-up-a-tumour\">Continue reading...</a>",
